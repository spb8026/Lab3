The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is a private research university in Rochester, New York. It was founded in 1829. It is one of only two institutes of technology in New York state, the other being the New York Institute of Technology.

RIT enrolls about 19,000 students, of whom 16,000 are undergraduate and 3,000 are graduate students. These students come from all 50 states in the United States and more than 100 countries. The university has more than 4,000 faculty and staff. It also has branches abroad in China, Croatia, Kosovo, and the United Arab Emirates. The university is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity".[6]
The university began as a result of an 1891 merger between Rochester Athenæum, a struggling literary society founded in 1829 by Colonel Nathaniel Rochester and associates, and The Mechanics Institute, a Rochester school of practical technical training for local residents founded in 1885 by a consortium of local businessmen including Captain Henry Lomb, co-founder of Bausch & Lomb. The name of the merged institution at the time was called Rochester Athenæum and Mechanics Institute (RAMI). The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school and took over The Rochester Athenaeum's 1829 founding charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, many of its students, administration and faculty staff alike, not only celebrated the former Mechanics Institute's 1885 founding charter, but its former name as well. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-established The Athenaeum's 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged research university.
The university originally resided within the city of Rochester, New York, proper, on a block bounded by the Erie Canal, South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately 43.152632°N 77.615157°W). Its art department was originally located in the Bevier Memorial Building. By the middle of the twentieth century, RIT began to outgrow its facilities, and surrounding land was scarce and expensive; additionally, in 1959, the New York Department of Public Works announced a new freeway, the Inner Loop, was to be built through the city along a path that bisected the university's campus and required demolition of key university buildings. In 1961, a donation of $3.27 million from local Grace Watson, for whom RIT's dining hall was later named, allowed the university to purchase land for a new 1,300-acre (5.3 km2) campus several miles south along the east bank of the Genesee River in suburban Henrietta. Upon completion in 1968, the university moved to the new suburban campus, where it resides today.[7][8]
In 1966, RIT was selected by the federal government to be the site of the newly founded National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID).[9] NTID admitted its first students in 1968, concurrent with RIT's transition to the Henrietta campus.[10]
In 1979, RIT took over Eisenhower College, a liberal arts college located in Seneca Falls, New York.[11] Despite making a 5-year commitment to keep Eisenhower open, RIT announced in July 1982 that the college would close immediately. One final year of operation by Eisenhower's academic program took place in the 1982–83 school year on the Henrietta campus. The final Eisenhower graduation took place in May 1983 back in Seneca Falls.[12]
The microelectronic engineering program, created in 1982 and the only ABET-accredited undergraduate program in the country,[13] was the nation's first Bachelor of Science program specializing in the fabrication of semiconductor devices and integrated circuits. In 1990, RIT started its first PhD program, in imaging science – the first PhD program of its kind in the U.S.[12] The information technology program was the first nationally recognized IT degree, created in 1993.[14] In 1996, RIT became the first college in the U.S. to offer a Software Engineering degree at the undergraduate level.[15]
The main campus is housed on a 1,300 acres (5.3 km2) property. This property is largely covered with woodland and fresh-water swamp making it a very diverse wetland that is home to a number of somewhat rare plant species. The campus comprises 237 buildings and 5.1 million square feet (470,000 m2) of building space. The nearly universal use of bricks in the campus's construction – estimated at 15,710,693 bricks as of August 6, 2018[16] – prompted students to give it the semi-affectionate nickname "Brick City," reflected in the name of events such as the annual "Brick City Homecoming." Though the buildings erected in the first few decades of the campus's existence reflected the architectural style known as brutalism, the warm color of the bricks softened the impact somewhat. More recent additions to the campus have diversified the architecture while still incorporating the traditional brick colors. The main campus was listed as a census-designated place in 2020.[17]
In 2009, the campus was named a "Campus Sustainability Leader" by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.[18]
The residence halls and the academic side of campus are connected with a walkway called the "Quarter Mile". Along the Quarter Mile, between the academic and residence hall side are various administration and support buildings. On the academic side of the walkway is a courtyard, known as the Infinity Quad due to a striking polished stainless steel sculpture (by Jose' de Rivera, 1968, 19'×8'×21⁄2') of a continuous ribbon-like Möbius strip (commonly referred to as the infinity loop because if the sun hits the strip at a certain angle it will cast a shadow in the shape of an infinity symbol on the ground) in the middle of it; on the residence hall side is a sundial and a clock. Standing near the Administration Building and the Student Alumni Union is The Sentinel, a steel structure created by the acclaimed metal sculptor, Albert Paley. Reaching 70 feet (21 m) high and weighing 110 tons, the sculpture is the largest on any American university campus. There are four RIT-owned apartment complexes: Global Village, Perkins Green, Riverknoll, and University Commons.
Along the Quarter Mile is the Gordon Field House, a 160,000 sq ft (15,000 m2), two-story athletic center. Opened in 2004 and named in honor of Lucius "Bob" Gordon and his wife Marie, the Field House hosts numerous campus and community activities, including concerts, career fairs, athletic competitions, graduations, and other functions. Other facilities between the residence halls and academic buildings include the Hale-Andrews Student Life Center, Student Alumni Union, Ingle Auditorium, Clark Gymnasium, Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena, and the Schmitt Interfaith Center.
The RIT Art Collection, part of the RIT Archive Collections at RIT Libraries, comprises thousands of works, including hundreds by RIT faculty, students, and alumni. The collection grows every year through the Purchase Prize Program, which enables the university to purchase select art works from students in the School of Art and Design, the School for American Crafts, and the School of Photographic Arts and Sciences.[19]
As of 2017, the president is David C. Munson Jr., formerly the dean of engineering at the University of Michigan. Munson, the university's tenth president, took office on July 1, 2017, replacing William W. Destler, who retired after 10 years at RIT.[30] Prabu David, formerly vice provost at Michigan State University, was named provost in August 2023.[31] He replaced Ellen Granberg, the first woman to serve in that role at RIT.
The university is chartered by the New York state legislature and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.[34][35] The university offers more than 200 academic programs, including seven doctoral programs across its nine constituent colleges.[36][37] In 2008–2009, RIT awarded 2,483 bachelor's degrees, 912 master's degrees, 10 doctorates, and 523 other certificates and diplomas.[38]
The four-year, full-time undergraduate program constitutes the majority of enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction in the "arts & sciences/professions."[6] RIT is a member of the Rochester Area College consortium, which allows students to register at other colleges in the Rochester metropolitan area without tuition charges.[37] RIT's full-time undergraduate and graduate programs used to operate on an approximately 10-week quarter system with the primary three academic quarters beginning on Labor Day in early September and ending in late May.[37] In August 2013, RIT transitioned from a quarter system to a semester system.[39] The change was hotly debated on campus, with a majority of students opposed according to an informal survey; Student Government also voted against the change.[40]
Among the eight colleges, 6.8% of the student body is enrolled in the Saunders College of Business, 15.0% in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering, 4.3% in the College of Liberal Arts, 25.4% in the College of Applied Science and Technology, 18.0% in the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, 13.9% in the College of Imaging Arts and Science, 5.7% in the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and 9.2% in the College of Science.[41] The five most commonly awarded degrees are in Business Administration, Engineering Technology, School of Photographic Arts & Sciences, School of Art and Design, and Information Technology.[42]
RIT has struggled with student retention, although the situation has improved during president Destler's tenure. 91.3% of freshmen in the fall of 2009 registered for fall 2010 classes, which Destler noted as a school record.[43]RIT enrolled 13,711 undergraduate and 3,131 graduate students in fall 2015.[41] Admissions are characterized as "more selective, higher transfer-in" by the Carnegie Foundation.[6] RIT received 12,725 applications for undergraduate admission in Fall 2008, 60% were admitted, 34% enrolled, and 84% of students re-matriculated as second-year students. The interquartile range on the SAT was 1630–1910. 26% of students graduated after four years and 64% after six years.[46] As of 2013, the 25th–75th percentile SAT scores are 540–650 Critical Reading, 570–680 Math, and 520–630 Writing—the average composite score being 1630–1960.
In 2017, RIT was ranked No. 97 (tie) in the National Universities category by U.S. News & World Report.[53] Business Insider ranked RIT No. 14 in Northeast and No. 36 in the country for Computer Science.[54][55] RIT was ranked among the top 50 national universities in a national survey of "High School Counselors Top College Picks".[56] RIT's Saunders College of Business ranked No. 26 in the United States for "Best Online MBA Programs" for the online executive MBA program by U.S. News & World Report.[57] Times Higher Education/The Wall Street Journal ranked the MBA program at Saunders College of Business No. 54 among business colleges and universities around the world for the year 2019.[58] RIT was ranked among the top 20 universities recognized for excellent co-operative learning and internship programs.[59] It was further placed at No. 24 in the top 30 universities for Computer Science with the best Returns on Investment (ROI) in the US.[60]

The Princeton Review ranked RIT No. 8 nationally for "top schools for video game design for 2019" in undergraduate programs[61] and No. 7 in graduate programs.[62] Among the top 75 universities for Video Game Design in the US, RIT was ranked No. 4.[63]
RIT's co-op program, which began in 1912, is the fourth-oldest in the world. It is also the fifth-largest in the nation,[64] with approximately 3,500 students completing a co-op each year at over 2,000 businesses.[65] The program requires (or allows, depending on major) students to work in the workplace for up to five quarters alternating with quarters of class. The amount of co-op varies by major, usually between 3 and 5 three-month "blocks" or academic quarters. Many employers prefer students to co-op for two consecutive blocks, referred to as a "double-block co-op". During a co-op, the student is not required to pay tuition to the school and is still considered a "full time" student.
RIT library services are based in the Wallace Library. The Cary Graphic Arts Collection contains books, manuscripts, printing-type specimens, letterpress printing equipment, documents, and other artifacts related to the history of graphic communication.[66] RIT Archives document more than 180 years of the university's history, and students in the Museum Studies program frequently work with these artifacts and help create exhibitions.[67] The RIT/NTID Deaf Studies Archive preserves and illustrates the history, art, culture, technology, and language of the Deaf community.[68] The RIT Art Collection contains thousands of works showcasing RIT's visual arts curriculum.[19]
The Vignelli Center for Design Studies was established in 2010 and houses the archives of Italian designers Massimo and Lella Vignelli.[69] The center is a hub for design education, scholarship and research.[70]
Founded in 2020, the Global Cybersecurity Institute was funded in part by a $50 million gift from RIT alumnus Austin McChord.[71] The gift also funded four named endowments for students and cybersecurity researchers.[72] In 2022, the Institute received a $3 million naming gift from ESL Federal Credit Union, a Rochester-area company that provides banking and wealth management services.[73]
In 1986, RIT founded the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, and started its first doctoral program in Imaging Science in 1989. The Imaging Science department also offers the only Bachelors (BS) and Masters (MS) degree programs in imaging science in the country. The Carlson Center features a diverse research portfolio; its major research areas include Digital Image Restoration, Remote Sensing, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Printing Systems Research, Color Science, Nanoimaging, Imaging Detectors, Astronomical Imaging, Visual Perception, and Ultrasonic Imaging.

The Center for Advancing the Study of CyberInfrastructure (CASCI) is a multidisciplinary center housed in the College of Computing and Information Sciences. The Departments of Computer science, Software Engineering, Information technology, Computer engineering, Imaging Science, and Bioinformatics collaborate in a variety of research programs at this center. RIT was the first university to launch a Bachelor's program in Information technology in 1991, the first university to launch a Bachelor's program in Software Engineering in 1996, and was also among the first universities to launch a Computer science Bachelor's program in 1972. RIT helped standardize the Forth programming language, and developed the CLAWS software package.

RIT has collaborated with many industry players in the field of research as well, including IBM,[86] Xerox,[87] Rochester's Democrat and Chronicle,[88] Siemens,[89] NASA,[90][91] and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).[92] In 2005, it was announced by Russell W. Bessette, Executive Director New York State Office of Science Technology & Academic Research (NYSTAR), that RIT will lead the University at Buffalo and Alfred University in an initiative to create key technologies in microsystems, photonics, nanomaterials, and remote sensing systems and to integrate next generation IT systems. In addition, the collaboratory is tasked with helping to facilitate economic development and tech transfer in New York State. More than 35 other notable organizations have joined the collaboratory, including Boeing, Eastman Kodak, IBM, Intel, SEMATECH, ITT, Motorola, Xerox, and several Federal agencies, including as NASA.[93]

In 2017, the U.S. Department of Energy selected RIT to lead its Reducing Embodied-Energy and Decreasing Emissions (REMADE) Institute aimed at forging new clean energy measures through the Manufacturing USA initiative.[94]
RIT was a long-time member of the Empire 8, an NCAA Division III athletic conference, but moved to the Liberty League beginning with the 2011–2012 academic year. All of RIT's teams compete at the Division III level, with the exception of the men's and women's ice hockey programs. Those teams play at the Division I level in Atlantic Hockey America, formed after the 2023–24 season by the merger of the Tigers' former hockey homes of the men-only Atlantic Hockey Association and the women-only College Hockey America. In 2010, the men's ice hockey team was the first ever from the Atlantic Hockey Association to reach the NCAA tournament semi-finals: The Frozen Four.[95]

In 2011–2012, the RIT women's ice hockey team had a regular season record of 28–1–1, and won the NCAA Division III national championship, defeating the defending champion Norwich University 4–1. The women's team had carried a record of 54–3–3 over their past two regular seasons leading up to that point.[96] The women's hockey team then moved from Division III to Division I. Starting in the 2012–2013 season, the women's team played in the College Hockey America conference. In 2014–2015, the team became eligible for NCAA Division I postseason play.[97]

In 2021, the RIT men's lacrosse team beat Salisbury in double overtime to take the NCAA Division III national championship.[98] In 2022, the RIT men's lacrosse team won a second national title, following a 12–10 victory over Union College.[99]

RIT's Alpine Ski Club competes at United States Collegiate Ski & Snowboard Association (USCSA), which uses NCAA II competition and academic standards.[100] The varsity Alpine Ski Team competes at the USCSA Mid East Region.[101]

Tom Coughlin, coach of the NFL's 2008 and 2012 Super Bowl champion New York Giants, taught physical education and was the head coach of the RIT Men's Varsity Football team for four seasons in the early 1970s. Overseeing RIT football's transition from a club sport to an NCAA Division III team, this was the first head coaching job of Coughlin's career with him calling his time at RIT "a great experience."[102]

Since 1968 RIT's hockey teams played at Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena on campus. In 2010, RIT began raising money for a new arena.[103] In 2011, B. Thomas Golisano and the Polisseni Foundation donated $4.5 million for the new arena, which came to be named the Gene Polisseni Center.[104]
RIT's athletics nickname is the "Tigers", a name given following the undefeated men's basketball season of 1955–56. Prior to that, RIT's athletic teams were called the "Techmen" and had blue and silver as the sports colors. In 1963, RIT students fundraised using ‘Tigershares’ to buy a rescued Bengal tiger cub that became the university's mascot, named SpiRIT which stands for Student Pride in RIT. Ambitious students were trained as the Tiger Cubs handlers and took him to most sport events until 1964. It was then discovered that the cub was ill and eventually he was put down due to these health complications.[105] The original tiger's pelt now resides in the RIT Archive Collections at RIT Libraries.[106] RIT helped the Seneca Park Zoo purchase a new tiger shortly after SpiRIT's death, but it was not used as a school mascot. A bronze sculpture by D.H.S. Wehle in the center of the Henrietta campus now provides an everlasting version of the mascot.[107]
In addition to its academic and athletic endeavors, RIT has over 150 student clubs, 10 major student organizations, an interfaith center and 30 different Greek organizations.[109]

Reporter magazine, founded in 1951,[110] is the university's primary student-run magazine.[111] RIT also has its own ambulance corps, bi-weekly television athletics program RIT SportsZone, pep band, radio station, and tech crew.

The university's Gordon Field House and Activities Center is home to competitive and recreational athletics and aquatics, a fitness center, and an auditorium hosting frequent concerts and other entertainment. Its opening in late 2004 was inaugurated by concerts by performers including Kanye West and Bob Dylan.[112][113] It is the second-largest venue in Monroe County.[114]
One of RIT's unique features is the large presence of deaf and hard-of-hearing students, who make up 8.8% of the student body.[115] The National Technical Institute for the Deaf, one of RIT's nine colleges, provides interpreting and captioning services to students for classes and events. Many courses' lectures at RIT are interpreted into American Sign Language or captioned in real-time for the benefit of hard-of-hearing and deaf students. There are several deaf and hard-of-hearing professors and lecturers, too; an interpreter can vocalize their lectures for hearing students. This significant portion of the RIT population provides another dynamic to the school's diversity, and it has contributed to Rochester's high number of deaf residents per capita.
