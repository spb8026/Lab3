The Rue de Montmorency is a street in the historic Le Marais quarter of Paris, part of the city's 3rd arrondissement. It runs from the Rue du Temple to the Rue Saint-Martin.
== History ==
The street was named in 1768 after the Montmorency family, prominent residents of Le Marais during the Renaissance period. The Montmorency family is one of the oldest and most distinguished families in France, derived from the city of Montmorency, now in the Val-d'Oise département, about 9 miles (15 km) northwest of Paris. As the Montmorency was a noble family, the street lost its name at the French Revolution. Therefore, it was known between the end of the French Revolution and 1806 as the Rue de la Réunion.
== Notable buildings ==
The Rue de Montmorency is fairly representative of the ancient streets of the heart of Paris.
No. 5, stood a mansion where Mary Magdalene of Castile and Nicolas Fouquet lived from 1651 to 1658. She brought a dowry to this vast parish located in Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs, at the corner of future streets Michel-le-Comte, the Temple, and Montmorency. The mansion belonged until 1624 to the Montmorency family. Nicolas Fouquet was nominated Superintendent of Finance by Anne of Austria in 1653. Théophile de Viau also lived there. A neoclassical fountain is still visible in the garden of the current Hôtel Thiroux Lailly.
No. 6, porch Louis Philippe. From 1966 to 2006, the Morder family (Bernard and Hela) and their two sons (Joseph and Robi) lived there. Joseph Morder became a film director and is considered the "Pope of the Super 8". From 2000 to 2005, the Iranian painter Zohreh Eskandari lived and worked there, as well as the singer Lio.
No. 8, Madame de Sévigné lived from 1676 to 1677.
No. 10 stood a print shop, La ruche ouvrière (The working hive), founded after the Second World War by Yervant Aprahamiantz, who had close relationship with European libertarian scene, more particularly with Nestor Makhno and Volin. This print shop that he managed took the form of a workers' cooperative. Many leaflets, posters, newspapers, pamphlets and books published by French, Bulgarian and Spanish libertarians were printed there. A fire destroyed the building in 1980, which was subsequently rebuilt.
No. 44, Henry Segal lived there. He died in Slovakia on August 9, 1948, close to village Kozelnik working as volunteer on the Youth Railway Construction Project.
No. 51, stands the house of Nicolas Flamel.
=== House of Nicolas Flamel ===
The house of Nicolas Flamel, at no. 52, which was built in 1407 by Flamel himself, still stands, the oldest stone house in Paris, at 51 rue de Montmorency; the ground floor, always a tavern, currently houses the Auberge Nicolas Flamel. Nicolas Flamel, a scrivener and manuscript-seller who developed a reputation as an alchemist, claimed that he made the philosopher's stone, which turned lead into gold, and that he and his wife Pernelle achieved immortality. Engraved images were discovered during recent works on this house.
On the facade of the building one can still read this inscription: "Nous homes et femes laboureurs demourans ou porche de ceste maison qui fut faite en l'an de grâce mil quatre cens et sept somes tenus chascun en droit soy dire tous les jours une paternostre et un ave maria en priant Dieu que sa grâce face pardon aus povres pescheurs trespasses Amen".
This religious foundation included a gable wall, which has since disappeared. The first two floors remain and still retain their original decoration: the famous Gothic inscription mentioned above, as well as the pillars of the base moldings and decorations of angels and columns. On the second and fifth pillars are engraved with the initials "NF" in homage to the founder of the place. This decoration appears to be the work of a funerary engraver from the neighboring cemetery of Saint-Nicolas des Champs.
This house has been the subject of new restorations in June 2007 and is now a restaurant.
== Geographic situation ==
The street is close to the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, housed in the medieval priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs. It is also located very close to the Centre Georges Pompidou (also named Beaubourg Museum). Numerous modern art galleries can be found on the Rue de Montmorency.
== Trivia ==
The novel Rhum from the French writer Blaise Cendrars takes place in a brick foundry located at 14 rue de Montmorency.

On February 19, 1862, the 37th United States Congress passed An Act to Prohibit the "Coolie Trade" by American Citizens in American Vessels. The act, which would be called the Anti-Coolie Act of 1862 in short, was passed by the California State Legislature in an attempt to appease rising anger among white laborers about salary competition created by the influx of Chinese immigrants at the height of the California Gold Rush. The act sought to protect white laborers by imposing a monthly tax on Chinese immigrants seeking to do business in the state of California.
== Initial frustration with Chinese labor ==
Prior to the California gold rush of the 1850s, the Chinese population in the west, described at the time with the derogatory word "coolie", was minimal and tolerated by many Americans who migrated to the west to explore the new frontier. However, the California gold rush not only led to a steep increase in the white American population but also in the Chinese through immigration to the West. In 1852, California experienced an influx of 20,026 Chinese immigrants as compared to 2,716 just the year before. The large of influx of immigrants were met with race riots as white miners became frustrated with the increased competition for business.
The intense emotions felt by a dense workforce, however, had more room to heat up, as they were exacerbated when America went through a recession between 1853 and 1854. The 1853 recession, characterized by low growth in the United States economy , featured American businesses contracting by 18.4% as interest rates rose and railroad investments decreased. The decrease in railroad investments drastically slowed down investments in the Wild West of California. What's more, commodity prices, including gold, dropped during that period. Thus, coupling the decrease in railroad investments with falling gold prices, the very source of the West's boom was strongly hurt and this served to worsen conditions in the west. The atmosphere would then become increasingly hostile, as segregation tools in the region were created, beginning with the creation of "coolie clubs".
== Coolie clubs ==
In the wake of the 1853 recession, many Californians who owned the rights to the land on which the gold was mined were looking for cheap labor to maximize profits. Chinese immigrants came to America for a variety of reasons, including longstanding trans-Pacific economic connections, a culture of migrant work in the Pearl River delta region, and the presence of reasonably fast trade routes to the United States, and the allure of gold.  Many Chinese immigrants made the voyage on credit, and upon arrival in California had no choice but to accept lower wages to repay their creditors. As a result of their lower demand for wages, and their tendency to form self-supporting communities without much support from their employers, Chinese immigrants became the preferred option of labor for many landowners. Domestic miners responded with the creation of "anticoolie" clubs that sought to create clear divisions between white workers and Chinese workers. The clubs almost served like white unions that represented the interests of the white miners in the west, and they expanded in prominence as manufacturing jobs moved to the west and Chinese workers continued to play the role of cheap labor. In 1857, just a few years prior to the passage of the Anti-Coolie Act in California, Chinese workers were accepting wages between one and two dollars less than their white counterparts.
== Anti-Coolie Act of 1862 ==
The California legislature's formal attack on Chinese immigrants began in 1852 with the passage of a foreign miners' tax that imposed a three-dollar monthly tax on foreign miners in the state. In 1855, the California legislature followed up the passage of that act with another act entitled Discourage the Immigration to this State of Persons who Became Citizens thereof. However, after more pressure came from white miners, who teamed up with sympathizers in the Democratic Party to encourage the passage of the Anti-Coolie Act, it was indeed passed. The act was ratified by California's state legislature on April 26, 1862 and was an attempt to increase the scope of their authority by levying a $2.50 tax on anyone of Chinese origin who applied for licenses "to work in the mines, or to prosecute some kind of business...."  Yet, with the Chinese population still steadily increasing, reaching 107,000 in 1890, the act marked only the beginning of direct segregation against the Chinese.
What would follow from the 1862 Anti-Coolie Act would be several anti-Chinese acts that served to discriminate against them. Eight years later, the Naturalization Act of 1870 allowed Africans to become citizens through naturalization, while continuing to exclude Asians. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which more directly restricted Chinese immigration and naturalization.

The Full Text of the Act


Succumbs is R.E.M.'s first commercially available full-length movie. Released in October 1987 by UNI/A&M, it contains video footage shot by R.E.M.'s lead singer Michael Stipe dating back to the early-1980s, while the band was still recording under the I.R.S. Records label. Stipe collaborated with local Athens, Georgia artist James Herbert, who directed Left of Reckoning.
Succumbs offers a glimpse of the unique feel of the band before their commercial success. It was released only on VHS and laserdisc, however, all the videos contained in this package are included on the When the Light Is Mine DVD, released in September 2006.
An introductory clip at the beginning of the collection features guitarist Peter Buck and the band's then-manager, Jefferson Holt, introducing "citizens of the future" to an "outmoded artform" called the "video", predicting it would have a staying power similar to that of Nehru jackets and other forgotten fads.

Estelle Hall Young (1884-1938) was a leader of the African-American women's suffrage movement in Baltimore, Maryland. She founded the Colored Women's Suffrage Club and worked tirelessly to support suffrage for African-American people.
== Biography ==
Estelle Hall was born in Georgia in 1884. She studied to be a teacher at Spelman College and Atlanta University. She studied under W.E.B. DuBois at Spelman. She taught in Atlanta until she moved to Baltimore in 1905. 
In Baltimore, she married Dr. Howard E. Young, the first Black owner-and-operator of a pharmacy. They had three children together: two sons and one daughter. Their daughter N. Louise Young became the first Black woman licensed to practice medicine in Maryland.
== Suffrage activism ==
Young established a Colored Women's Suffrage Club in West Baltimore and became its first president in 1915. The organization was also called the Progressive Suffrage Club. The club eventually outgrew the living rooms where they were held, and they moved to the Colored Y.W.C.A. on Druid Hill Avenue.
After the adoption of the 19th Amendment, Young rallied Black women in Maryland to send a message to legislators who tried to defeat the legislation, because it would increase the pool of Black voters. She continued to hold voter education classes at the Y.W.C.A. to help new voters access and use their right.
She organized new chapters, including one in Montgomery County, and led weekly meetings to help women register and vote. She worked with local churches to spend five minutes at the beginning of Sunday services to speak about voter registration, and her efforts made a difference. Unlike white women voters who left civil rights work after the passage of the 19th amendment, Young and her community continued.
Young and her husband tested housing segregation laws in Baltimore in 1913. They purchased a house in a white neighborhood, and asked the Black community to help them pay the fines from the city's housing segregation laws. They did not receive the financial support and rented the house to a white family. 
Young was an active part of the DuBois Circle in Baltimore and hosted meetings at her home. Members of the DuBois Circle were prominent Black women that discussed Black literature and history, and they voiced their support for women's suffrage. Since Young was a student of DuBois at Spelman College, she arranged for him to visit the Circle.
Young was asked to speak at the Sharp Street Methodist Episcopal Church at a Women's Day event in 1918.
She was active in the 1920s and 1930s in the Republican party, and lobbied her senators to support anti-lynching legislation.
In the 1930s, Young was given an award from NAACP's Maryland State Conference of Branches.
== Death and legacy ==
Young died in August 1938 in Baltimore. She is buried at Mt. Auburn Cemetery, alongside her husband and daughter.

Ajman Fort is a double-storey traditional rock, coral and mudbrick fortification in the centre of the city of Ajman in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Its construction is thought to date back to the late 18th century and it is claimed the fort's barjeel, or wind tower, is the oldest such structure in the UAE.
== Establishment ==
Ajman Fort has been central to the history of the city and emirate of Ajman and its rulers for over 200 years. The establishment of Ajman as an independent emirate under Al Nuaimi rule took place when Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi and fifty followers took effective control of the coastal settlement of Ajman in a short conflict. The consolidation of that establishment did not take place until 1816 or 1817, when Ajman Fort finally fell to Rashid and his followers. Rashid was duly recognised as the Ruler of Ajman by the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi, who had previously claimed Ajman under his sphere of influence or suzerainty. 
In 1821, Ajman Fort fell briefly to a force of Darawisha Bedouin, who were removed by the action of Saqr bin Sultan of Sharjah.
Rashid bin Humaid's rule saw the bombardment of Ajman and its fort from the sea by British forces in the course of the 1819 punitive expedition mounted by the British against the Qawasim. This led to Rashid bin Humaid becoming a signatory to the General Maritime Treaty of 1820. The fort was completely destroyed in the action.
The peaceful accession of Rashid's son, Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, as Ruler of Ajman in 1838 was not to last long however, and in 1841 Humaid's brother Abdelaziz bin Rashid Al Nuaimi took possession of Ajman fort and declared himself Ruler. In 1848, Abdelaziz bin Rashid was killed during an armed conflict with Ajman's secessionist neighbouring town of Hamriyah. On Abdelaziz' death, Humaid, who was also wounded in the conflict, became Ruler once again.
== The fort in conflict ==
In June 1920, Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi, the headman of another secessionist neighbour of Ajman's, Al Heera, seized Ajman Fort and declared himself ruler in place of the-then Ruler of Ajman, Humaid bin Abdulaziz Al Nuaimi. He was only removed after the intercession of the British Residency Agent acting in concert with Khalid bin Ahmed Al Qasimi of Sharjah. Khalid subsequently raised a force together with Humaid bin Abdulaziz and they attacked Abdulrahman in Al Heera. Again, the British intervened and an agreement was made that recognised Abdulrahman as a subject of Khalid's and bound him to cause no further trouble.
Irritated by constant British mediation over the Al Heera affair, Humaid bin Abdulaziz defied the British in the matter of a manumission certificate which he had allegedly torn up. Refusing to come on board a British ship to meet with the British Resident and also refusing to pay a 1,000 Rupee fine levied on him, he was finally threatened with bombardment, HMS Crocus and HMS Cyclamen both being offshore at the time. Humaid threatened the British that it would "be the worse for them" if they dared to bombard his fort and they commenced fire. The subsequent bombardment once again reduced the fort and, with one of its great towers totally demolished and a second crumbling under withering cannon fire, Humaid sued for peace and paid the fine.
== Police station to museum ==
In 1967, Rashid bin Ḥumaid Al Nuaimi – who had ruled Ajman from Ajman Fort since 1928 – moved out of the fort and the building was given over to become the headquarters of Ajman Police. It was occupied by the police until 1978. The fort was then abandoned before being restored in the early 1980s. It is now home to Ajman Museum and forms the centrepiece of the Dhs 25 million Ajman Heritage District, a tourist attraction featuring restored buildings and walkways with some 37 shops, opened in October 2020.

Matagorda Peninsula Army Airfield is a closed military airfield, located on Matagorda Island, Texas.   It was used during  World War II as a training airfield by the 77th Flying Training Wing, Army Air Forces Central Flying Training Command.
== History ==
=== World War II ===
The airfield was built during 1942 by the Army Air Corps, primarily to support the Matagorda Bombing Range. In addition it was also developed as a training school by Army Air Forces Training Command.   Matagorda AAF was the home of the AAF Pilot School (Advanced Single Engine), and also conducted a Single-Engine Pilot Transition school.   The major military units assigned were the  62d Single Engine Flying Training Group and 79th Bombardier Training Group.
Initially built with three runways,  during the war two additional runways were added to accommodate the large number of landings and takeoffs.  Aircraft assigned to the base were North American AT-6 Texans, Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, and North American P-51 Mustangs.    A series of curved roads on the east side of the parking ramp had dozens of buildings.  After the war ended, the training school was inactivated and the facility was closed in November 1945.
=== Civil use ===
After the war ended, the airfield was transferred to civil control, and was known as Matagorda Peninsula Airport.
In the late 1940s, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics considered Matagorda Island as a rocket launch site, however Cape Canaveral, Florida was chosen instead.
In the 1980s, a private firm, Space Services, Inc. of America (SSIA), established a rocket launch facility on the island for commercial rockets with the airport, known as Pierce Field, providing aircraft access.
However SSIA only ever conducted two rocket tests at this facility. The first was of their Percheron rocket which exploded on the pad during an engine test firing on 5 August 1981, and then a single successful launch of their Conestoga I on 9 September 1982, which became the first privately funded rocket to reach space.
The airfield remained active until about 2002 when SSIA ended its use of Matagorda Island, and the airport was closed and abandoned.
Today, the airport is closed and its facilities are deteriorating. Some old rocket launch stands can be found in the area. The World War II military base was dismantled and no longer remains.

Psechridae is a family of 	araneomorph spiders with about 70 species in two genera. These are among the biggest cribellate spiders with body lengths up to 2 centimetres (0.79 in) and funnel webs more than 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in diameter.
The family belongs to the RTA clade of spiders because they all have a Retrolateral Tibial Apophysis on the male pedipalp.
A recent phylogenetic analysis places Psechridae as close relatives of the lynx spiders, wolf spiders, and nursery web spiders.
They feature several characteristics normally found in ecribellate spiders, for example brood care behavior, and a colulus with no apparent function. They have greatly elongated legs, with the last element being very flexible. Female Psechrus carry their egg-sac in the chelicerae, similar to their relatives, the ecribellate Pisauridae. Members of Psechrus construct horizontal webs lace webs, while Fecenia construct pseudo-orbs, similar to orb webs of Orbiculariae spiders in an example of evolutionary convergence.
== Distribution ==
They occur in southeastern Asia, ranging from India in the west, to Solomon Islands in the east, reaching as far south as northern Australia, and north to central China. They are found in forest, rocky areas, and caves from lowlands to altitudes exceeding 2,000 metres (1.2 mi).
== Genera ==
As of April 2019, the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:

Zemach Shabad (Hebrew: צמח שאבאד, Polish: Cemach Szabad, Russian: Цемах Шабад, Tsemakh Shabad; 5 February 1864, Vilnius, Russian Empire (now Vilnius, Lithuania) — 20 January 1935, Vilnius) was a Jewish medical doctor and social and political activist. He was a member of the Senate (parliament) of the Second Polish Republic (1928) and a co-founder and vice-president of the YIVO (Institute for Jewish Research).
In 1932, Shabad toured to Palestine with Dr. Abel Lapin from Kaunas. During his trip, Shabad hosted by the Health Committee of the Knesset and the Jerusalem Medical Association.
He was one of the originators of the volkist movement, which eventually turned into the Folkspartei (Jewish People's Party).
In the late 1930s a monument on the outskirts of Vilnius was erected in Shabad's honor; it was destroyed during WWII. In 2007 he was honoured with another monument in Vilnius, reflecting the fact that he was the prototype of "Doctor Aybolit", a good doctor from a children's poem by Korney Chukovsky.

Khovd (Mongolian: Ховд [ˈχɔw̜t]), formerly known as Kobdo or Khobdo, is the capital of the Khovd Province of Mongolia. It is the administrative seat of the Jargalant sum.
== Geography and climate ==
Khovd is situated at the foot of the Altay Mountains, and is bisected by the Buyant River. The Khar-Us Lake is located approximately 25 km (15.5 mi) east of Khovd and is the site of a Strictly Protected Area (Mongolian Government designation), called the Mankhan Nature Preserve.
In 1992, as the result of the Mongolian government passing a series of administrative and land reforms, Khovd was integrated as part of the Jargalant sum created in the area. The total city area is 80 km2 (30.8 mi2.)
According to the Köppen climate classification, Khovd has a cold desert climate, marked with long, dry, frigid winters and short warm summers. Precipitation is minimal and very heavily concentrated in summer.
== History ==
The city was established by Galdan Boshogtu Khan of Dzungaria in the 17th century on the bank of the river Khovd in what is now Erdenebüren sum. Horticulture was developed around city Khovd using the land cultivating experience from Taranchi and Central Asian captives. The city was 'moved' by the Qing administration after destruction of the Dzungar Khanate after 1757 on to the bank of the river Buyant.
On 7 August 1912, the Mongol troops under leadership of Manlai Baatur Damdinsuren, Khatanbaatar Magsarjav and Ja Lama Dambiijantsan captured the city of Khovd, destroyed all the Manchu-Chinese garrisons and abolished the governance of the Qing-appointed amban.
== Population ==
The city had a population of 26,023 in 2000 (2000 census), 30,479 in 2003 (est.) and 28,601 in 2007. The 2010 population was recorded at 29,046.
In 2005, Jargalant sum (the centre of Khovd Aimag) had 32,351 inhabitants (6,675 households), belonging to more than ten ethnic groups and nationalities such as Uuld, Khalkh, Zakhchin, Torguud, Uriankhai, Myangad, Dörbet, Bayads, Kazak, Chantuu and Üzemchin.

The rufous-vented whitetip (Urosticte ruficrissa) is a species of hummingbird  in the "brilliants", tribe Heliantheini in subfamily Lesbiinae.  It is found in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The rufous-vented whitetip and purple-bibbed whitetip (Urosticte benjamini) have been treated as conspecific and as distinct species, each by multiple authors. Since the early 2000s there is consensus that they are species in their own right. They are the only members of their genus and both are monotypic.
== Description ==
The rufous-vented whitetip is 9 to 10 cm (3.5 to 3.9 in) long and weighs 4 to 4.2 g (0.14 to 0.15 oz). Both sexes have a medium-length straight black bill and a prominent white stripe behind the eye. Both have shining green upperparts and a forked tail, though the female's is not as deeply indented as the male's. Males have shining green underparts with buffy undertail coverts. The tail is dusky bronze; the central feathers have wide white tips. Females have white underparts spotted with green. The tail is dusky bronze with white tips on the outermost feathers. Juveniles are similar to females with the addition of brown edges on the head feathers.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The rufous-vented whitetip is found on the eastern slope of the Andes from Colombia's Huila and Nariño departments south through eastern Ecuador into Peru's Department of San Martín. It inhabits the interior and edges of partly open montane forest and cloudforest between elevations of 1,600 and 2,400 m (5,200 and 7,900 ft).
== Behavior ==
=== Movement ===
The rufous-vented whitetip is generally sedentary but locally moves to higher elevations after breeding.
=== Feeding ===
The rufous-vented whitetip mostly forages from near the ground to the forest's mid level. It collects nectar from a variety of flowering plants including bromeliads and members of genera Clusia and Palicourea. In addition to feeding on nectar it captures insects by hawking from a perch and sometimes by gleaning from vegetation.
=== Breeding ===
The rufous-vented whitetip's breeding season spans from January to April. It builds a cup nest of moss and typically places it in vines 2 to 4 m (7 to 10 ft) above the ground. The female incubates the clutch of two eggs for 15 to 18 days; fledging occurs 22 to 24 days after hatch.
=== Vocalization ===
The rufous-vented whitetip makes a "mellow, fast twittering 'tweetweetweetwee...'" that can sound like "a laughing chatter". While feeding in flight it also makes "a single lower-pitched scratchy note 'tzrrrrr'".
== Status ==
The IUCN has assessed the rufous-vented whitetip as being of Least Concern, though its population size is not known and believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified. It is generally uncommon throughout its restricted range. It occurs in several protected areas in Colombia but the Ecuadorean cloudforest is heavily logged.

The Gdium is a subnotebook / netbook computer produced by EMTEC. The Gdium product is distinguished by its unique Loongson MIPS processor and the use of a USB key as a primary storage device. The Gdium netbook is marketed as an interface device to the Gdium "learning community"—a website that provides hardware support, MIPS builds of open-source software, Linux computing tips, and educational resources targeted towards teachers and students within the K-12 demographic.
== Technical overview ==
The EMTEC Gdium Liberty 1000 is built on an STMicroelectronics Loongson 2F MIPS microprocessor and uses a proprietary form-factored USB key, called the G-Key, as its primary storage medium. The G-Key, which fits in a specially designed USB slot recessed within the unit, is available in 8GB and 16GB capacities. The key generates no noise, and is less susceptible to mechanical shock damage than hard drives. It also includes an SD card reader, which provides support for MMC, SD and SDHC cards as supplemental storage.
The Gdium uses Mandriva as its sole operating system and boots in approximately 30 seconds. The desktop uses the Metacity window manager with a lxplanel and idesk-based interface. Like most modern Linux distributions, open-source software applications such as OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and The GIMP are included in the default installation. There are no compilations of Microsoft Windows, OS X, or Ubuntu available for the MIPS architecture, but e.g. Debian offers packages compiled for MIPS.
The EMTEC Gdium Liberty 1000 specifications are as follows:
Screen size: 10" (254 mm)
Resolution: 1024 x 600
CPU: 900 MHz 64-bit Loongson 2F by STMicroelectronics
Operating system: Mandriva G-Linux
Video chipset: Silicon Motion SM502 (16 MB dedicated video memory)
RAM: 512 MB DDR2 (supports up to 1 GB, not user upgradeable)
Primary Storage: 16 GB to 32 GB USB G-Key (removable)
Webcam: 0.3 or 1.3 Mpx
Keyboard: 240mm long and 96.8mm wide.
Wireless LAN: IEEE 802.11b/g
LAN: 10/100 Mbit/s
Battery: 5000 mAh / 2.5 hours (some users report ~30 minutes)
SD / SDHC Card reader
3 USB ports available: 2 standard USB 2.0 and 1 USB 2.0 for the G-Key
1 VGA ext 15pin D-sub enabling 1280x1024 external monitor resolution
Speakers/headset Output: 1 port for 3.5mm audio jack
Microphone Input: 1 port for 3.5mm microphone jack
Dimensions: 250 x 182 x 32 mm
Weight: 1.2 kg
== Starting phase ==
Gdium was originally planned for release in September 2008, but after multiple hardware and software glitches attributed to poorly managed contracted labor across France and China, the product was delayed until end of February 2009 for its soft launch. Gdium's soft launch was on the Belgium market and received a mild user acceptance.
The target price of the Gdium at Euro 379 makes the Gdium an expensive and poorly valued netbook given its modest hardware and short battery life. Analysts have wondered if a market actually exist for it.

Hexworthy  is a hamlet on Dartmoor, in Devon, England.  It lies on the West Dart River a mile upstream from Dartmeet.  Historically in the parish of Lydford, since 1987 it has been in the civil parish of Dartmoor Forest.
Hexworthy has an inn, the Forest Inn, opened in the 1850s.
Very close to the village, on the opposite bank of the West Dart, is the hamlet of Huccaby, which has a parish church with an unusual dedication to St Raphael.
There was a long history of tin mining near Hexworthy.  Tin works in the valley of the O Brook were first recorded in 1240, and the Henroost or Hexworthy Mine did not close until 1919.

Jean-Baptiste Dumouchelle (5 April 1784, in Dumouchel – 29 March 1844) was born in Sandwich (now Windsor), Quebec. He was a leading figure in Saint-Benoît through his pursuits as a militia officer, general merchant and magistrate.
== Education and career ==
At the age of 11 Dumouchelle left Sandwich, completing his classical studies at Collège Saint-Raphaël in Montreal in 1803. He later worked as a clerk and then became a general merchant at Saint-Benoît making him a well established figure in the town. After his marriage to Victoire Felix and the birth of their four children, Dumouchelle achieved the rank of captain in the Rivière-du-Chêne battalion of militia serving in the War of 1812.
After the war, in 1815, Dumouchelle returned to his business in Saint-Benoît where he gained an interest in politics. He held an active role in meetings performed by the Patriotes during 1827. His participation in these meetings was considered outrageous and he was banned from the militia because of it. He was later reinstated into the militia serving as a major in the Deux-Montagnes battalion of militia.
Dumouchelle was again dismissed from the militia for his participation in the revolutionary gatherings leading up to the Rebellions of 1837. Even though he took no part in the rebellion of 1837 Dumouchelle was arrested along with his sons on December 17 and held until July 8, 1838. When he returned to Saint-Benoît he found his home and business in ruins from the pillaging of Colborne's troops during 1837.

Strixton is a small village in eastern Northamptonshire that borders the main A509 road between Wellingborough and Milton Keynes. The population of the village remained less than 100 at the 2011 Census and is included in the civil Parish of Wollaston.
The village's name means 'Strikr's farm/settlement'. This name might be indistinguishable from the 'Stric' recorded in the Domesday Book as holding land in the adjoining Bozeat and Wollaston parishes during the reign of Edward the Confessor.
The village borders Grendon and Wollaston. The limited amenities include:
The Church (St Rumwolds).
A business centre - utilising converted farm buildings.
== The Church ==
St Rumwold was a little-known Saxon Saint who is said to have preached the Gospel after his baptism as an infant; his resting place is recorded as being in Buckingham, but it is thought that there may also be some connection with Romaldkirk in Northern England, which is not properly recorded.
In the 19th century attempts were made to rededicate the church to "John the Baptist" - but this never happened. The church is thirteenth-century and remains now largely as it was built. Inside the church there is a 15th-century screen which is the only late Gothic feature of the church and Nikolaus Pevsner reports that it is "...simple with one light division". The church also owns a Jacobean chalice and paten dating to 1628, which is currently on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum.
According to Pevsner, the church was rebuilt in 1873 with old materials except for the western wall, which has a triple-chamfered doorway and a sexfoil window that has over it a wavy frame. There is a small cusped lancet to the right. In the church the windows are said to be mostly pairs of lancet windows. The communion rail is detailed as being with heavily twisted balusters.

Michael Grossman (born 1942) is an American health economist and economics professor emeritus at the City University of New York Graduate Center (CUNY). He directed the Health Economics Program at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) from 1972 to 2020. Grossman was an early contributor to New Home Economics (NHE).
Grossman received his bachelor's degree from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in 1964. He received his doctorate in economics from Columbia University in 1970. In 1966, Grossman was hired as a research assistant by Victor Fuchs at NBER. In 1972, he was hired by CUNY as a visiting assistant professor. He earned his professorship in 1978 and in 1988 became Distinguished Professor of Economics. From 1983 to 1995, he chaired the University's doctoral economics program.
Grossman was co-editor of the Review of Economics of the Household from 2005 to 2017, and was the inaugural recipient of the Victor Fuchs Award for Lifetime Contributions to the Field of Health Economics, presented by the American Society of Health Economists in 2008. His 1972 model of health production has been extremely influential in health economics. Grossman's work on health economics was inspired by his professors Gary Becker and Jacob Mincer, the founders of the New Home Economics. Grossman has argued for a causal relationship between schooling and health.

Israel Perkins Warren (April 8, 1814 – October 9, 1892) was an American minister, editor, and author.
Warren, the eldest of seven children of Isaac and Leonora (Perkins) Warren, was born in that part of Woodbridge which is now Bethany, Connecticut, on April 8, 1814.  In 1830 he was apprenticed to a tailor in what is now Naugatuck, Connecticut.; but having in the spring of 1831 become a Christian, he was led to decide to study for the ministry, and was released by his employer for this purpose.  He graduated from Yale College in 1838.  During part of his Senior year and for a year from graduation, he taught in an academy in what is now Cromwell, Conn., and for two years after graduation, he studied in the Yale Divinity School.
In August, 1841, he began to supply the pulpit of the Congregational Church in Granby, Conn., where he was ordained as pastor on April 20, 1842. His dismission from this charge, at his own request, took effect on May 1, 1845. From July 8, 1846, to September 23, 1851, he was pastor of the Congregational Church at Mount Carmel, in the township of Hamden, Conn.; and from October 2, 1851, to February 3, 1856, he held the same relation in Plymouth, Conn. In June, 1856, he accepted an appointment as one of the Corresponding Secretaries of the American Seamen's Friend Society in New York City. In May, 1859, he was chosen Secretary of the American Tract Society at Boston, and served in that office and as editor of the Society's publications until Jan. 1, 1869. After resigning this position, he formed a partnership with his former parishioner, Gen. Erastus Blakeslee, for the publication and sale of books.
In the fall of 1875 he removed to Maine to edit The Christian Mirror, the organ of the Congregational Churches of that State.  On April 1, 1877, he purchased the paper, and he continued as its editor and proprietor until his death, at his home in Portland, after some months of feebleness, on October 9, 1892, aged 78 years.
The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by Iowa College in 1868. He did a large amount of editorial work while connected with the Tract Society, much of the material published being from his own pen. Besides other periodicals, he edited for three years (1867–69) The Sabbath at Home, an illustrated monthly magazine of a high order. His published volumes numbered over twenty; among which are especially to be noted, The Four Gospels and Acts, with Notes, 1871; The Three Judges, 1873, The Parousia, 1879; and The Stanley Families of America, 1887.
On August 25, 1841, he married Jane S., second daughter of Captain Thomas Stow, of Cromwell, Conn., who died on February 26, 1881. Their children were two daughters who died in infancy, and one son (Yale College 1869). He next married, on January 2, 1882, Sarah, daughter of Captain John L. Lewis, and widow of Henry Cushman, of Portland, who died on November 26, 1885. On October 6, 1886, he married Juliet M., daughter of Dr. Albert F. Stanley, of Winthrop, Me, who survived him.

CJKR-FM (97.5 MHz) is a Canadian radio station broadcasting in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It airs an classic alternative format with the on-air brand name "Power 97". The station is owned and operated by Corus Entertainment, which also owns sister stations CJOB and CFPG-FM. The studios and offices are located at 201 Portage Avenue in downtown Winnipeg, while its transmitter is located on Brady Road in south Winnipeg.
CJKR was formerly the most powerful FM radio station in Canada, operating with 310,000 watts. Most FM stations in Canada and the United States run 100,000 watts or less. Because CJKR-FM is one of the oldest FM stations in Canada, it was grandfathered with a much higher power. (In Winnipeg, CBW-FM also operates with an unusually high power, 160,000 watts). Following a fire to its transmitter in 2021, the station has been operating on reduced power, with plans to install a new HD Radio antenna operating at 93,900 watts.  Power 97 is simulcast on Shaw Direct channel 860.
== History ==
The station first signed on the air on May 27, 1948 as CJOB-FM, an FM simulcast of CJOB. The station applied to the Board of Broadcast Governors (BBG) to move its broadcast frequency from 103.1 MHz to the current 97.5 MHz. It began airing distinct programming in 1962, featured a country format as CHMM-FM in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and then changed its format to soft rock and its call sign to CKIS-FM in 1984. In the late 1980s, CKIS moved to a rock format, which was not in compliance with its licence at that time. Eventually, the station was allowed to amend its licence, stick with the rock format, and changed its call letters to CJKR-FM in 1991. In the late 2000s, the station moved from mainstream rock to active rock by reducing the classic rock in its playlist, aiming at a youthful male audience.
=== Changing owners and studios ===
In 2000, Western International Communications sold its Winnipeg stations to Corus Entertainment. In April 2010, Corus Radio Winnipeg announced the relocation of its radio broadcast facility to 1440 Rapelje Avenue (since renamed Jack Blick Avenue), as part of a lease agreement between Corus Entertainment and Cadillac Fairview. The relocation to Polo Park was scheduled for January 2011. CJOB, CJGV-FM and CJKR-FM would become the anchor tenants. Corus Radio Winnipeg planned to occupy the second floor of the three-storey building, expanding its radio, production and business operations to 17,500 square feet (1,630 m2). At the time, general manager Garth Buchko said the stations had outgrown their 930 Portage Avenue facility. With the move, Corus Radio Winnipeg would also upgrade to state-of-the-art, fully digital on-air systems. At the end of February 2011, CJKR-FM completed the move to its new location at 1440 Jack Blick Avenue.
As of April 2021, the three stations are again back in downtown Winnipeg at 201 Portage Avenue. It is unknown when they were moved to this current location.
=== Big FM ===
At Noon on January 29, 2015, after playing "Fade to Black" by Metallica, CJKR began stunting with liners promoting that Winnipeg would be getting "bigger" the following day at 8 a.m., interspersed between 5-second clips of songs with the word "big" in them. At that time, CJKR flipped to a classic rock format as 97.5 Big FM, putting it in direct competition with long-time classic rock station CITI-FM (although that station still plays current rock songs describing itself as mainstream rock). The first song on "Big" was "Big Time" by Peter Gabriel. The new format was being described as a "homage to Winnipeg's rock heritage", with a playlist that is "familiar, and less predictable and has rock credibility". In November 2015, veteran broadcaster Shadoe Davis was hired for "The Shadoe Davis Show" from 6-10am weekdays. In March, he was joined by another veteran Winnipeg broadcaster, Joe Aiello. "Shadoe & Joe" can now be heard together with traffic reports from Randy Parker and news with Kathy Kennedy.
=== Return to Power 97 ===
On August 12, 2016, CJKR rebranded back to Power 97, and returned to its active rock format. The first song played on the newly relaunched "Power 97" was Give It Away by Red Hot Chili Peppers.
On October 5, 2020, it was announced that CJKR will serve as FM co-flagship of the Winnipeg Jets under a seven-year deal with Corus, with games airing in simulcast with sister AM station CJOB. During game broadcasts, CJKR's rock format is heard on the station's online stream.
On October 8, 2024, CJKR flipped to classic alternative, while retaining the Power 97 branding.

Christopher Arthur Geoffrey Burney MBE (1917 – 18 December 1980) was an upper-class Englishman who served in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II.
== Biography ==
In 1941, Pierre de Vomécourt organized AUTOGYRO, one of the first resistance networks of Section F of the Special Operations Executive.  Among de Vomécourt's recruits were Georges Bégué, the first SOE agent ever to be parachuted into France, who was assigned as the wireless operator; Noel Fernand Raoul Burdeyron (real name: Norman F. Burley); and Mathilde Carre.
Lack of money, weapons, and personnel, along with spotty communications with London meant that AUTOGYRO accomplished little. In frustration, Burdeyron/Burley singlehandedly derailed a German supply train by pulling up a rail, AUTOGYRO's only successful attack, causing considerable German casualties. Impressed, SOE decided to send Burdeyron some assistance. They recruited Christopher Burney, a lieutenant in the British Army and a trained commando, who had lived in France and spoke idiomatic French without an accent.  On 30 May 1942, under the code name "Charles", he was inserted by parachute into France along with William Grover-Williams, on a different mission under the code name "Sebastian".
After being blind-dropped into the French countryside, Burney made his way to his rendezvous with Burdeyron. Circling the building, he spotted several suspicious men watching from various positions. He immediately concluded that his rendezvous had been blown and AUTOGYRO betrayed (it had – Mathilde Carre was in fact, a double agent). He quietly left, and never attempted any further contact with Burdeyron or de Vomécourt.
Burney then tried to create his own network, but after eleven weeks learned that the Abwehr was passing around a circular warning bank clerks, hotel clerks, and others to be on the lookout for a man named "Charles" who was asking strange questions, and offering a reward for tips on his whereabouts. The circular contained a good description of Burney who, tall and blonde, was very conspicuous in Normandy. Deciding he had done all he could, he planned his escape over the Pyrenees to Spain and back to England.  Grover-Williams offered his help, and Burney met with him several times to organize the escape, but on the morning he was to meet Grover-Williams for the last time, Burney was surprised in his sleep by Abwehr agents who had been tipped off by a hotel clerk familiar with the circular.
The Germans locked him up, first in Fresnes prison, for 15 months of solitary confinement, then in Buchenwald concentration camp. While at Buchenwald, Burney would meet F.F.E. Yeo-Thomas and also subsequently meet Phil Lamason, the senior officer in charge of 168 allied airmen and would help - at great risk - with their transfer to a POW camp.
Freed in 1945, he worked after the war for the newly formed United Nations, helping to commission their building in New York City.  When Dutch diplomat and UN Assistant Secretary-General Adrian Pelt was posted from 1949 to 1951 in the Franco-British UN Trust Territory of Libya as UN Commissioner for Libyan Independence, Burney was assigned as his assistant. In the 1950s, banking magnate Siegmund Warburg recruited him as a manager for the British and French Bank.
Burney's younger brother, Roger Burney, was one of two British officers killed on 18 February 1942 when the French submarine Surcouf  was mysteriously sunk in the Caribbean.
In 1966, Frank Kermode, somewhat controversially, included Burney's experience of time passing in Solitary Confinement in his own major critical work of Western experience of passing time in The Sense of an Ending.

Rose-Marie is an operetta-style musical with music by Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart, and book and lyrics by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II. The story is set in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and concerns Rose-Marie La Flemme, a French Canadian girl who loves miner Jim Kenyon. When Jim falls under suspicion for murder, her brother Emile plans for Rose-Marie to marry Edward Hawley, a city man.
The work premiered on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on September 2, 1924, running for 557 performances.  It was the longest-running Broadway musical of the 1920s until it was surpassed by The Student Prince (1926). It was then produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London in 1925, enjoying another extraordinary run of 581 performances.  It was filmed in 1928, in 1936 and again in 1954.
The best-known song from the musical is "Indian Love Call".  It became Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy's "signature song". Several other numbers have also become standards, including the title song.
== Background ==
Producer Arthur Hammerstein, attempting to create popular new Broadway shows in the operetta tradition, sought exotic, unusual settings for his new productions. The Fortune Teller (1898) is set in Hungary, The Merry Widow (1907) takes place in France, and Naughty Marietta (1910) features New Orleans.  He sent his nephew, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Otto Harbach to Quebec, Canada, to witness a rumored magnificent ice sculpture festival. The men reported that there was not, nor had there ever been, such a festival in Quebec or any part of Canada.
Arthur Hammerstein still liked the Canadian setting, and Oscar Hammerstein II and Harbach began work on the book for a new musical set in the Canadian Rockies.  Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart collaborated on the score, and opera star Mary Ellis was cast in the title role. British actor and singer Dennis King was cast opposite her as Jim Kenyon.
== Productions and adaptations ==
Stage versions
Rose-Marie premiered on September 2, 1924 at the Imperial Theatre in New York City, running for 557 performances.  Direction was by Paul Dickey and choreography was by Dave Bennett.  The orchestrations were by Robert Russell Bennett.  Costumes were designed by Charles LeMaire, and settings were by Gates and Morange.  It had a brief revival on Broadway in 1927.
It was then produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London in 1925, enjoying another extraordinary run of 581 performances.  The original West End production had a chorus of eighty.  It was London's most successful Broadway show after World War I until it was surpassed by Oklahoma!.  In Paris's Théâtre Mogador, Rose-Marie ran for an unprecedented 1,250 performances.
A touring company premiered the work in Canada on January 12, 1925 at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, and the piece toured Australia and played in Paris.  Other Canadian productions were given by the Variétés lyriques in 1937 and another in 1945, in French, and by Theatre Under the Stars in 1940, Melody Fair in 1951, and the Eaton Operatic Society in 1959. It was produced by the Light Opera of Manhattan several times in the 1970s and 1980s, the Shaw Festival in Canada (1981), Light Opera Works of Illinois (1987), and Ohio Light Opera in 2003.
Film versions
The show has been filmed three times, including a silent film in 1928.  Joan Crawford starred in this version, alongside James Murray.  The best known film version was released in 1936, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Although the plot was changed, and most of the songs were dropped, it was a huge success and became MacDonald and Eddy's best-known film.  In 1954, MGM produced an Eastmancolor version in Cinemascope, which more closely followed the original plot, but it still dropped most of Friml's songs.  This version starred Ann Blyth, Howard Keel and Fernando Lamas, with Bert Lahr and Marjorie Main as comic relief. It was choreographed by Busby Berkeley.
Little Mary Sunshine
Rose-Marie is the main (but not the only) target of the satirical musical Little Mary Sunshine, which parodies elements of the plot as well as the style of several of the songs. In particular, the song "Colorado Love Call" from Little Mary Sunshine is a parody of "Indian Love Call" from Rose-Marie.
== Synopsis ==
Act I
In Fond-du-Lac, Saskatchewan, Canada, trappers, hunters and travellers gather at "Lady" Jane's hotel ("Vive la Canadienne").  Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Malone is flirting with Lady Jane, while wealthy city man Edward Hawley is watching a French Canadian girl, Rose-Marie La Flamme, even though she's miner Jim Kenyon's sweetheart.  Rose-Marie's brother, Emile, is searching for her, fearing she is alone with Jim. Wanda, a half-blooded Indian, dances close to Hawley, enraging her Indian lover, Black Eagle.  Lady Jane's man, the cowardly "Hard-Boiled Herman", arrives at the bar.  Jim arrives to greet Rose-Marie enthusiastically and explains to Sergeant Malone that he has given up his former wild ways because of his love for "Rose-Marie".  Black Eagle claims some land (and the gold on it) belonging to Jim and Herman.  Herman thinks that shooting Black Eagle will solve everything, but Jim prefers to use legal means, declaring that he will visit Black Eagle and show him the boundary line the property map.  Sergent Malone and "The Mounties" warn Herman that they will not hesitate to enforce the laws.
Emile is going to take Rose-Marie with him to the trapping grounds at Kootenay Pass.  He dislikes Jim and wants her to marry Hawley for financial security.  Rose-Marie doesn't want to go, insisting to her brother that she is in love with Jim ("Lak Jeem").  Hawley plans to accompany Emile, but first he has to end his affair with Wanda.  He plans to visit her at Black Eagle's log cabin and bribe her to stay away from him.  Jim tells Rose-Marie that he will follow her to Kootenay Pass, and they will meet in an old house he calls a castle near a valley with a beautiful echo.  According to legend, Indians would call down into the valley to the girls they wished to marry ("Indian Love Call").
Hawley meets Wanda at her cabin and tries to pay her off, just as Jim arrives with a map to prove his claim.  Wanda sends Jim away.  Black Eagle returns home and catches Wanda and Hawley embracing.  He attacks Hawley, and Wanda stabs Black Eagle to save Hawley.  Jim and Herman, unaware of the murder, follow Emile, Hawley, and Rose-Marie to Kootenay Pass.  Jim and Rose-Marie communicate through their "Indian Love Call" (reprise).  Emile tells Rose-Marie that she should marry Hawley because he could buy her all the "Pretty Things" she wants.  Wanda arrives at Kootenay Pass and tells everyone that Jim is wanted for the murder of Black Eagle; his map was discovered near Black Eagle's body.
Herman continues romancing Lady Jane ("Why Shouldn't We?").  Hawley proposes to Rose-Marie, but she refuses him.  He and a city girl whom he has employed, Ethel Brander, try to impress Rose-Marie with the glamour of city life in Quebec.  Wanda leads an Indian "Totem-Tom-Tom" dance.  Jim has received an offer from the Brazilian government to lead a mining project there.  He asks Rose-Marie to come with him, even though it would be safer for her to go to Quebec and wait for him there.  If she decides to come, they will meet at the "castle" and go to the United States to be married.  If she does not, she should sing the Indian Love Call up the valley to him. Rose-Marie insists she will go with him; he leaves immediately, and she plans to follow twenty minutes later to avoid attracting suspicion.  Sergeant Malone arrives with a warrant to arrest Jim for murder.  Emile knows that Jim is hiding in the "castle".  He tells Rose-Marie that he will not reveal Jim's hiding place to the Mounties if she will go to Quebec and marry Hawley.  Holding back tears, Rose-Marie tells Hawley that she must sing the "Indian Love Call" to him, but she is really singing to Jim, telling him that she will not go with him.
Act II
Many months have passed.  Rose-Marie is about to marry Hawley in Quebec, believing that Jim was the killer.  Ethel Brander has convinced her that Jim murdered Black Eagle because he loved Wanda.  Herman and Lady Jane have married, and they have a shop in Quebec.  He still flirts with other women, but he catches her giving Sergeant Malone "Only a Kiss".  Jim returns with Wanda intending for her to clear his name.  But, seeing Wanda, Rose-Marie jumps to conclusions about Jim and Wanda.  Rose-Marie tells Jim that she loves Hawley ("I Love Him").
The wedding preparations commence ("The Minuet of the Minute"), and Wanda jealously threatens Hawley.  Sergeant Malone prepares to arrest Jim, who is hiding in Kootenay Pass, even though Malone is troubled by the evidence.  Herman suspects Wanda and gets her to confess by pretending that Hawley has accused her of the murder.  Jane interrupts them and incorrectly assumes Herman is cheating on her ("One Man Woman").  The wedding begins ("Doorway of My Dreams"), but as Rose-Marie walks down the aisle, Wanda publicly confesses to the murder and declares her love for Hawley.  Everyone rushes to Jim's lodgings, and Rose-Marie goes to the pass to return Jim's "Indian Love Call".  The lovers are finally united.
== Music ==
=== Musical numbers ===
=== Musical style ===
In Rose-Marie, Friml and Stothart emulated the late 19th-century Viennese operetta style of Johann Strauss II and American composer Victor Herbert, using lilting waltzes and sweeping romantic or sentimental passages.  They added to this new dance styles, notably the foxtrot (for example in the title song of the show).
== Recordings ==
The operetta has been recorded a number of times.  The 1925 original London cast recorded six numbers along with an orchestral medley. These recordings have been collected on a number of LP and CD editions. Al Goodman recorded the major songs in 1948 as part of his series of operetta recordings for RCA Victor. These were reissued on LP on the budget RCA Camden label in 1958.
Nelson Eddy recorded eight numbers for a Columbia Records ten-inch Lp in 1950.  Around the same time, singles recorded by Eddy and MacDonald in 1936, at the time of the film's release, were reissued in an extended Play 45-rpm disc by RCA Victor  Red Seal as ERA 220. The sleeve featured a photo of the two of them as they appeared in the film. The MGM soundtrack album of the 1954 technicolor and CinemaScope remake was released on records just prior to the film's premiere in March 1954.
The most complete recording released prior to 2022 was made in 1958 by RCA Victor (LSO-1001) starring Julie Andrews and Giorgio Tozzi.  In 1961 EMI issued an LP of selections with Barbara Leigh, David Hughes, Andy Cole and Maggie Fitzgibbon (Cole and Fitzgibbon had appeared together in a 1961 London revival). The following year, Reader's Digest included a recording of one side of highlights in their 12-record Treasury of Great Operettas set. The Smithsonian Institution recorded the complete score, performed in concert in 1981, conducted by James R. Morris, starring Debra Vanderlinde and Ron Raines, but the recording was not commercially released until 2022.

In the canon law of the Catholic Church, canonical provision is the regular induction into a benefice.
== Analysis ==
It comprises three distinct acts - the designation of the person, canonical institution, and installation. In various ways a person may be designated to fill a vacant benefice: by election, postulation, presentation, or recommendation, resignation made in one's favour, or approved exchange. In all cases confirmation by the proper ecclesiastical superior of the selection made is required, while letters of appointment, as a rule, must be presented.
Reception of administration by a chapter without such letters brings excommunication reserved to the pope, together with privation of the fruits of the benefice; and the nominee loses ipso facto all right to the prelacy. Ordinarily greater benefices are conferred by the pope; minor benefices by the bishop, who as a rule has the power of appointing to all benefices in his diocese. The pope, however, owing to the fullness of his jurisdiction, may appoint to any benefice whatsoever. 
=== History ===
In England, since a charter of 1214, bishops had been appointed by free canonical election of cathedral chapters. Therefore in the thirteenth century, it was unusual for a bishop to be appointed by papal provisions, however by the fourteenth century it had become much more common.  When the Hundred Years War between France and England started in 1337, the papal court sat in Avignon and favored France, so relations between England and the papacy became increasingly tense. The pope filled many of the English vacancies with his own appointees. These appointees did not reside in England, but collected revenues from their benefices anyway. When some of these revenues found their way into the French royal treasury, many Englishmen complained to Parliament about the abuse, and an English statute (Statute of Provisors) was enacted in 1351 to prevent the pope from exercising several of his prerogatives. Similar enactments were made in 1390 and in later years. These statutes were finally repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1948.
At present, the Pope makes use of this right only in certain defined circumstances. The bishop's power is further restricted at times to confirming an election or postulation; or to approving candidates presented by one who enjoys the right of presentation by privilege, custom, or prescription.
== Canonical institution ==
Canonical institution or collation is the concession of a vacant benefice by one who has the authority. If made by the sole right of the prelate, it is free; if made by legal necessity, for example, after due presentation or election, or at the command of a superior, it is styled necessary. An ecclesiastical benefice cannot be lawfully obtained without canonical institution.
== Installation ==
Installation, called corporal or real institution, is the induction into the actual possession of a benefice. In the case of a bishop it is known as enthronization or enthronement. Corporal institution, according to common law, belongs to the archdeacon; by custom to the bishop or his vicar-general. It may take place by proxy: the rite observed depends much on custom. 
To installation belong the profession of faith and oath, when prescribed.

Something in the City is a 1950 British comedy film directed by Maclean Rogers and starring Richard Hearne, Garry Marsh and Ellen Pollock. It was written by H. F. Maltby and Michael Pertwee. It includes an early uncredited performance by Stanley Baker as a police constable.
== Plot ==
Mr Ningle has been living a lie for seven years by pretending to still be commuting to his financial services job in the City of London from which he had been sacked. Every day, he journeys in and changes into the disguise of his alter ego: an artist who sells paintings on the pavement in Trafalgar Square.
His life is thrown into turmoil when his deception is nearly discovered by Mr. Holley, the father of his daughter Beryl's new fiancé, Richard. The father happens to be the managing editor of the Evening Courier newspaper, and worried about his prospective in-laws. A series of misunderstandings lead to the mistaken belief that Ningle has been murdered by "Artie the artist", leading to a massive police manhunt. Ningle manages to stage a fake suicide for Artie, while he reappears and pretends he had amnesia for the past 48 hours.
When Holley publishes an offer of a large sum to Artie by way of apology (having heard that he committed suicide), Ningle cannot resist "resurrecting" the artist, but Holley now suspects the truth. Ningle manages to outmanoeuvre him, however, and presents the money to Beryl and Richard, enabling them to marry despite the opposition of Richard's parents.

== Critical reception ==
The Radio Times Guide to Films gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: "After 40 years as a circus clown and music-hall comic, Richard Hearne finally found fame on TV as the fumbling old fool, Mr Pastry. But the performer was less fond of the character to whom he owed his fortune than the public, and Hearne frequently sought to escape from the corny slapstick of his children's shows. Here, he plays a pavement artist who convinces his wife he is a high financier. The cheery street folk simply don't ring true and the pathos makes Chaplin look like a cynic."
In British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959 David Quinlan rated the film as "average", writing: "Harmless comedy"

The Alpine companies (German: Hochgebirgskompanien) were specialized mountain infantry troops that were part of the Austro-Hungarian land forces during the First World War.
== History ==
Because normal forces could not be employed on reconnaissance and combat tasks in the high mountains of the Alps, in 1916 Alpine Streif companies (Streifkompanien) were established. They were renamed in 1917 to Hochgebirgskompanien ("Alpine companies" or, literally "high mountain companies"). The members of these companies represented all the ethnic groups of the monarchy together. They all had previous Alpine experience, either as a result of their agricultural experience or as Alpine tourists before the war, and were specifically trained for fighting in the mountains. The specially selected officers and men of the mountain companies were issued with Alpine equipment, and were intended, and in practice were able, to overcome natural obstacles even in the most difficult terrain.
== Mission ==
The mission of this specialist force (or Schwarm) was to secure and maintain climbing paths and routes in high-Alpine terrain, as well as to make military supply routes practicable. For this, they were equipped with wire cables, rope ladders, iron bars and other equipment.
== Organisation ==
An Alpine company was divided into a company HQ, three rifle platoons and a machine gun platoon equipped with two 07/12 machine guns, three to four mountain guide patrols, two telephone patrols and a technical section.
The replacement of personnel came from the units available in the respective branch of the army. Those battle casualty replacement battalions (Ersatzbataillone) from which the majority of the men in the individual companies originated, were designated as a replacement cadres; as a result they could be units in the Common Army or the k.k. Landwehr.
== Equipment ==
The personal equipment of a soldier in the Alpine companies consisted of: rucksack, alpenstock, snowshoes (Schneereifen), snow goggles, mountaineering boots, Krötteln (crampons) and, in accordance with regulations of 1918 for the equipment and clothing in mountain warfare: a pair of ten-pointed crampons, full ski equipment, avalanche cord, a pair of shoe covers, a pair of overmitts, a windcheater, windproof trousers and a snowsuit or – in its absence – a snow jacket.
The Alpine companies were among the most highly decorated units of the imperial forces. Several members were awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa, for example, Lieutenant Peter Scheider of the 17 Alpine Coy for the capture of the Monticello Ridge on the Tonale Pass (together with the 28 Coy under Lieutenant Toni Kaaserer) in the summer of 1918 during Operation Avalanche (Unternehmen Lawine).

Shogakukan has published the series since May 2016 under their Gagaga Bunko imprint. A manga adaptation with art by Eight Chida was serialized in Square Enix's shōnen manga magazine Monthly Gangan Joker from December 2017 to February 2021.

== Plot ==
Fumiya Tomozaki is a high school student who is on top of the leaderboards of the popular online game Attack Families under the in-game handle "nanashi". A social outcast, he regards Attack Families as a "godly game" that has perfect balance where equal amounts of effort is rewarded with equal amounts of success. In contrast, he considers real life to be a "trash game". One day following a match against the number two player "NO NAME", they agree to meet in person. When they do so, Tomozaki is surprised to find out NO NAME is actually a classmate of his named Aoi Hinami. Taken aback that Tomozaki is nanashi, Hinami decides to help him overcome his issues.
== Characters ==
Fumiya Tomozaki (友崎 文也, Tomozaki Fumiya)
Voiced by: Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (commercial), Gen Satō (anime) (Japanese); Adam Gibbs (English)
Tomozaki is a high school student who has been living as a social outcast at school. Due to his success in Attack Families, he often compares both his real life and gaming life. His perspectives begins to change as it is revealed to him that his perfect classmate Aoi Hinami, who all along has been trailing behind him at second place on Attack Families' leaderboards, regards real life as a winnable game and offers to be his walkthrough. He has a younger sister.
Aoi Hinami (日南 葵, Hinami Aoi)
Voiced by: Haruka Tomatsu (commercial), Hisako Kanemoto (anime) (Japanese); Faye Mata (English)
Hinami is Tomozaki's classmate who has been regarded as a perfect existence. She essentially excels at everything she does, whether socially, academically or in sports by leading her own class clique, topping the school in grades and excelling at track and field competitions, all while maintaining a likable personality. Behind the scenes, she puts in a terrifying amount of hard work, and is a strong believer of concrete, dedicated effort in order to succeed at everything. Hinami is also an avid fan of Attack Families, where she goes by "NO NAME", and hugely respects "nanashi" who she could not surpass despite her efforts in analyzing his playstyle and perfecting her defense techniques. She later becomes the student council president of their school.
Minami Nanami (七海 みなみ, Nanami Minami)
Voiced by: Ikumi Hasegawa (Japanese); Christina Kelly (English)
Nicknamed "Mimimi" by her friends and "Minmi" by Tama, she is an energetic, mischievous and popular classmate of Tomozaki who is in the track and field club with Hinami. While maintaining a cheerful demeanor, she has insecurities about herself and her personality that gives in easily to not ruin the mood. Mimimi has been persistent in pestering the lonely Tama into being her friend, and thus eventually established a close friendship with her. Despite her goofy appearance, she also excels at both studies and sports, yet is unable to dethrone Hinami, who perpetually holds first place. She ran against Hinami in the student council election but lost.
Fūka Kikuchi (菊池 風香, Kikuchi Fūka)
Voiced by: Ai Kayano (Japanese); Natalie Hoover (English)
Fūka is a reserved and book-loving classmate of Tomozaki who often spends time at the library. She initially took interest in Tomozaki under the misunderstanding that they both share an interest in the same author, whereas Tomozaki only used those books as a cover while doing strategic reviews on Attack Families in the library. Tomozaki comes forward and admits the misunderstanding, and despite that still resolves to try to read and understand the books Fūka loves, as they develop a friendship on it. Hinami initially identifies Fūka as the best prospect for Tomozaki to capture as a girlfriend, and has created multiple situations in order for Tomozaki to confess to clear his goal. She and Tomozaki end up dating.
Hanabi Natsubayashi (夏林 花火, Natsubayashi Hanabi)
Voiced by: Ryōko Maekawa (Japanese); Amber Connor (English)
Nicknamed "Tama" by her friends, she is a blunt and unsociable classmate of Tomozaki. Tama is especially close to Mimimi as Mimimi was the first to try and break through her barriers and befriend her, and they hold each other dear. Her blunt nature often leaves her disliked and, once, got her into trouble as she openly condemned Erika's actions of harassment and bullying, thus making her the target of bullying herself. As she suffers from bullying, Tomozaki, Mizusawa, Takei and Fūka, among others, decided to step in to help her develop social skills.
Yuzu Izumi (泉 優鈴, Izumi Yuzu)
Voiced by: Nene Hieda (Japanese); Kate Bristol (English)
Izumi is a social and empathetic classmate of Tomozaki who is a part of Erika's clique. As someone who dislikes conflict, she is often unwilling to stand up to Erika's unreasonable actions. Izumi was Tomozaki's first target to befriend to grow his interpersonal skills as she sits beside him in class. Izumi is in love with Nakamura, and has enlisted Tomozaki's help to teach her how to play Attack Families in order to become Nakamura's practice partner.
Takahiro Mizusawa (水沢 孝弘, Mizusawa Takahiro)
Voiced by: Nobunaga Shimazaki (Japanese); Stephen Fu (English)
Mizusawa is a popular, gregarious and good-looking classmate of Tomozaki who is a part of Nakamura's clique, as is often considered as the smartest and most level-headed member of the group. He often attracts the attention of girls and is an extremely smooth talker, as he is Tomozaki's role model on the way he speaks.
Shūji Nakamura (中村 修二, Nakamura Shūji)
Voiced by: Nobuhiko Okamoto (Japanese); Chris Hackney (English)
Nakamura is a domineering classmate of Tomozaki, who is the de facto leader of his own clique. He is overly competitive and petty when he loses, as shown when he loses to Tomozaki on Attack Families, dismissing his loss as a stroke of bad luck while practicing hard in order to win in a revenge match. He eventually accepts Tomozaki as part of his clique after acknowledging his strengths.
Takei (竹井)
Voiced by: Shuntarō Mizuno (Japanese); Matt Shipman (English)
Takei is a cheerful and airheaded classmate of Tomozaki, who is often the mood maker of Nakamura's clique. Considered as the densest member of the clique, he is often excluded from strategic meetings such as when they were planning a camping trip to get Nakamura and Izumi together. He loves to take the center of attention as he often volunteers to take class positions, and often entertains others with his spontaneous acts.
Erika Konno (紺野 エリカ, Kon'no Erika)
Voiced by: Sayaka KanekoEp. 2 credits (Japanese); AmaLee (English)
Erika is a classmate of Tomozaki's who is the queen bee of the class. Once someone gets on her bad side, she will start to bully them.
Tsugumi Narita (成田 つぐみ, Narita Tsugumi)
Voiced by: Akane Fujita (Japanese); Sarah Wiedenheft (English)

Leusë (Albanian definite form: Leusa) is a village in Gjirokastër County, southern Albania. At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Përmet.
== Name ==
Leusë takes its name from the Greek word "Eleusa" (Ελεούσα), which means "merciful". "Virgin Eleusa" is also one of the names of the Virgin Mary in Eastern Orthodox tradition.
== History ==
The settlement of Leusë is first mentioned in Ottoman fiscal records as far back as 1431. The location of the village perhaps derived from its vicinity to an easy route toward Ioannina that thus ensured a swift communication with Greece. As of 1880, Aromanians of the Farsharot subgroup inhabited the village. A school was opened in 1920. The village suffered great damage during World War II.
With the advent of the Albanian communist regime, most of the original inhabitants of the village emigrated and were replaced by peasant families from surrounding villages that worked in the new collectivised structures.
== Geography ==
Leusë is located on the slopes of Dhëmbel mountain, 1.3 kilometres (0.81 miles) from Përmet.
== Population ==
Nearly all the inhabitants of Leusë are Eastern Orthodox Christians. As of 2019, the village was left with around 120 residents, mostly elderly.
== Major festivities ==
The Feast of the Dormition of Mary is celebrated in Leusë according to a ritual which takes place throughout villages in southern Albania. People gather around the church on the night of 14 August and concludes with a mass in honour of the Virgin Mary on the following morning. Leusë's church falls within the general category of post-Byzantine churches in Albania.
A street festival also takes place in the narrow streets of Leusë at 14 August with live music performed by local folk groups.
== Economy ==
Transhumance is still practiced in Leusë. The inhabitants of Leusë face a critical situation regarding the supply of both water and electricity. The village does not have a sewage network.

Mormon fundamentalism (also called fundamentalist Mormonism) is a belief in the validity of selected fundamental aspects of Mormonism as taught and practiced in the nineteenth century, particularly during the administrations of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and John Taylor, the first three presidents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Mormon fundamentalists seek to uphold tenets and practices no longer held by mainstream Mormons. The principle most often associated with Mormon fundamentalism is plural marriage, a form of polygyny first taught in the Latter Day Saint movement by the movement's founder, Smith. A second and closely associated principle is that of the United Order, a form of egalitarian communalism.  Mormon fundamentalists believe that these and other principles were wrongly abandoned or changed by the LDS Church in its efforts to become reconciled with mainstream American society. Today, the LDS Church excommunicates any of its members who practice plural marriage or who otherwise closely associate themselves with Mormon fundamentalist practices.
There is no single authority accepted by all Mormon fundamentalists; viewpoints and practices of individual groups vary. Fundamentalists have formed numerous small sects, often within cohesive and isolated communities throughout the Mormon Corridor in the Western United States, Western Canada, and northern Mexico. At times, sources have claimed there are as many as 60,000 Mormon fundamentalists in the United States, with fewer than half of them living in polygamous households. However, others have suggested that there may be as few as 20,000 Mormon fundamentalists with only 8,000 to 15,000 practicing polygamy. Independent Mormon fundamentalist Anne Wilde investigated demographics and, in 2005, produced estimates that fell between the prior two sources, indicating there to be 35–40,000 fundamentalists at the time.
Founders of mutually rival Mormon fundamentalist denominations include Lorin C. Woolley, John Y. Barlow, Joseph W. Musser, Leroy S. Johnson, Rulon C. Allred, Elden Kingston, and Joel LeBaron. The largest Mormon fundamentalist groups are the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB).
== History ==
The LDS Church began prohibiting the contracting of plural marriages within the United States in 1890 after a decree by church president Wilford Woodruff. However, the practice continued underground in the U.S. and openly in Mormon colonies in northern Mexico and southern Alberta. According to some sources, many polygamous men in the United States continued to live with their plural wives with the approval of church presidents Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, and Joseph F. Smith.
Some fundamentalists have argued that the 1890 Manifesto was not a real revelation of the kind given by God to Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, and others, but that it was rather a politically expedient document intended by Woodruff to be a temporary measure until Utah Territory gained statehood. They make their argument based on textual evidence and the fact that the "Manifesto" is not worded in accordance with similar revelations in the LDS scriptures. This argument further holds that after joining the Union, Utah would have had the authority to enact its own laws with respect to marriage, rather than being bound by U.S. territorial laws that prohibited polygamy. Before statehood could be granted in 1896, however, the federal government required Utah to include a provision in its state constitution stating that "polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited."  Fundamentalists (and many scholars of Mormon history) also believe that a primary impetus for the 1890 Manifesto was the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887, a stringent federal law that legally dissolved the LDS Church, disenfranchised women (who had been given the vote in Utah in 1870), and required voters to take an anti-polygamy oath before being permitted to vote in an election.
With the selection of Latter-day Saint Reed Smoot to be one of Utah's representatives to the U.S. Senate in 1903, national attention was again focused on the continuation of plural marriage in Utah, which culminated in the Reed Smoot hearings. In 1904, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a "Second Manifesto", after which time it became LDS Church policy to excommunicate those church members who entered into or solemnized new polygamous marriages. The seriousness with which this new measure was taken is evinced in the fact that apostle John W. Taylor, son of the church's third president, was excommunicated in 1911 for his continued opposition to the Manifesto.
Today, the LDS Church continues to excommunicate members who advocate early Mormon doctrines such as plural marriage, enter into or solemnize plural marriages (whether in the United States or elsewhere), or actively support Mormon fundamentalist or dissident groups. Although some LDS Church members continue to believe in the doctrine of plural marriage without practicing it, Joseph Smith's teachings on plural marriage remain part of the scriptural canon of the LDS Church. The LDS Church prevents any of its members who sympathize with Mormon fundamentalist teachings from entering its temples.
During the 1920s, a church dissenter named Lorin C. Woolley claimed a separate line of priesthood authority from the LDS Church's hierarchy, effectively setting in motion the development of Mormon fundamentalism. Most of the Mormon polygamous groups can trace their roots to Woolley's legacy.
For the most part, the Utah state government has left the Mormon fundamentalists to themselves, unless their practices violate laws other than those prohibiting bigamy. For example, there have been recent prosecutions of men who belong to fundamentalist groups for marrying underage girls. In one highly publicized 2004 case, a man and one of his polygamist wives lost custody of all but one of their children until the wife separated herself from her husband. The largest government effort to crack down on the practices of fundamentalist Mormons was carried out in 1953 in what is today Colorado City, Arizona, which became known as the Short Creek Raid.
Other fundamental doctrines of the Latter Day Saint movement besides polygamy, notably the United Order (communalism), while equally important in the practices of some fundamentalist sects, have not come under the same scrutiny or approbation as has plural marriage, and the mainline LDS Church has mostly ignored this aspect of fundamentalism; in any case, no revelation or statement condemning it has ever been issued.
== Distinctive doctrines and practices ==
Most Mormon fundamentalists embrace the term Fundamentalist (usually capitalized). Mormon fundamentalists share certain commonalities with other fundamentalist movements, but also possess some clear distinctions of their own.
Fundamentalists within the Mormon tradition do see religious authority as inerrant and unchanging, but tend to locate this authority within their view of "Priesthood", which is conceived of as more of a charismatic authority and often physical lineage than an external organization. In this view, ordination lineage becomes all-important and an external organization such as a church may "lose" its theological authority while the "priesthood" (conceived in this abstract and individualistic sense) may continue via an alternative lineage. Mormon fundamentalists frequently assert that priesthood is prior to the Church.
Unlike more prevalent Biblical (non-Mormon) fundamentalist groups, who generally base their authority on an unchanging and closed canon of scripture, Mormon fundamentalists generally hold to a concept of "continuing revelation" or "progressive revelation," in which the canon of scripture may be continually augmented through the sermons and teachings of prophets whose preaching guides the community.
Another of the most basic beliefs of Mormon fundamentalist groups is that of plural marriage, which many of them view as essential for obtaining the highest degree of exaltation in the celestial kingdom. Mormon fundamentalists dislike the term "polygamy" and view "polygyny" as a term used only by outsiders. They also refer to plural marriage generically as "the Principle", "celestial marriage", "the New and Everlasting Covenant", or "the Priesthood Work."
The practice of plural marriage usually differs little from the manner in which it was practiced in the nineteenth century. However, in some fundamentalist sects it is considered acceptable for an older man to marry underage girls as soon as they attain puberty. This practice, which is illegal in most states, apart from polygamy itself, has generated public controversy. Examples include the Tom Green case, and the case in which a man from the Kingston Group married his 15-year-old cousin, who was also his aunt. Other sects, however, do not practice and may in fact vehemently denounce underage or forced marriages and incest (for example, the Apostolic United Brethren.)
In addition to plural marriage, Mormon fundamentalist beliefs often include the following principles:
the law of consecration also known as the United Order
the Adam–God teachings taught by Brigham Young and other early leaders of the LDS Church
the principle of blood atonement
the exclusion of black men from the priesthood
the belief that missionaries should teach "without purse or scrip"
Mormon fundamentalists believe both that these principles were accepted by the LDS Church at one time, and that the LDS Church wrongly abandoned or changed them, in large part due to the desire of its leadership and members to assimilate into mainstream American society and avoid the persecutions and conflict that had characterized the church throughout its early years.
== Terminology and relationship with the LDS Church ==
The term "Mormon fundamentalist" appears to have been coined in the 1940s by LDS Church apostle Mark E. Petersen to refer to groups who had left the LDS Church. However, Mormon fundamentalists do not universally embrace this usage and many simply consider themselves to be "Mormon". Today, the LDS Church considers the designation "Mormon" to apply only to its own members and not to members of other sects of the Latter Day Saint movement. One LDS leader went as far as claiming that there is no such thing as a "Mormon fundamentalist", and that using the two terms together is a "contradiction." The LDS Church suggests that the correct term to describe Mormon fundamentalist groups is "polygamist communities".
In rebuttal to this nomenclature argument, certain Mormon fundamentalists have argued that they themselves are in fact more correctly designated as Mormons in so far as they follow what they consider to be the true and original Mormon teachings as handed down from Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. Within this context, the LDS Church is often regarded by such fundamentalists as having abandoned several foundational aspects of Mormonism as noted above.
== Mormon fundamentalist sects ==
The majority of Mormon fundamentalists belong to sects that have separated themselves from the LDS Church. As such, most are considered to be "Brighamite" sects within the Latter Day Saint movement.
=== Apostolic United Brethren ===
The Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) is estimated to have about 5000 to 10000 members throughout Utah, Montana, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, Missouri, and Mexico and is perhaps the largest Mormon fundamentalist group. Several of its towns are organized into United Orders; the church has established a temple in Mexico, an Endowment House in Utah, and operates several schools.
The AUB emerged when their leader, Joseph W. Musser, ordained Rulon C. Allred as an apostle and counselor, which led to a split between Mormon fundamentalists in Salt Lake City and those in Short Creek, Arizona. 
The AUB is one of the more liberal of the Mormon groups practicing plural marriage. The leaders of the AUB do not arrange marriages nor do they authorize plural marriages for people under 18 or for those who are closely related.
=== Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ===
The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) is estimated to consist of 6000 members. A succession crisis has been brewing in the church since 2002, when Warren Jeffs (convicted of accessory to rape and sentenced to life in prison in 2011), became president of the church. There has been extensive litigation regarding the church, as property rights of disaffected members are weighed against the decisions of church leaders who hold trust to the land their homes are built on. A large concentration of members lives in the twin cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, as well as in Bountiful, British Columbia. The church built a temple near Eldorado, Texas. The members of the FLDS Church tend to be very conservative in dress and lifestyle.
Beginning April 4, 2008, over a four-day period, troopers and child welfare officials searched the church's YFZ Ranch and removed 416 children into the temporary custody of the State of Texas. Originally officials from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services took 18 girls into temporary custody of the state, after responding to a phone call from the YFZ ranch alleging physical and sexual abuse of a 16-year-old girl, who also claimed to have been married at age 15 to a 49-year-old man. On the following day, Judge Barbara Walther of the 51st District Court issued an order authorizing officials to remove all children, including boys, 17 years old and under out of the compound. The children were being held by the Child Protective Services 45 miles away, north of the ranch. 133 women also voluntarily left the ranch with the children. On May 29, 2008 the Texas Supreme Court ruled that CPS must return all of the children. The court stated, "On the record before us, removal of the children was not warranted." The call that provoked the raid was a hoax. Despite this, investigations resulting from this raid resulted in charges against twelve men associated with the FLDS Church, six of which have resulted in convictions ranging from 5 to 75 years in prison.
The considerable hardship faced by wives and children pursuant to state evictions has been reported, with testimonies of those affected. The story of Warren Jeffs and the FLDS Church has been popularized in the Netflix documentary, "Keep Sweet, Pray and Obey". The treatment of the wives of Warren Jeffs has been discussed by testimony from escapees, who established a women's refuge in Church property.
=== Bountiful, British Columbia Community ===
The first member of the group that bought property near Lister was Harold (aka) Michael Blackmore, who moved there with his family in 1946.  Other members of the church who believed in the principles of plural marriages soon followed. After Winston Blackmore became the bishop in the 1980s, the group took the name of Bountiful.
In 1998 the estimated population was 600 and has since grown to about 1,000. Most of the residents are descended from only half a dozen men.  The current FLDS bishop is James Oler.
In 2002 the Mormon fundamentalists in Bountiful divided into two groups: about half are members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church), and the other half are members of the Church of Jesus Christ (Original Doctrine) Inc.
==== Church of Jesus Christ (Original Doctrine) Inc. ====
The Church of Jesus Christ (Original Doctrine) Inc., is an FLDS-offshoot based on the teachings of Winston Blackmore, who split with the FLDS Church after concluding the president of the church, Warren Jeffs, had exceeded his authority and become too dictatorial.  This group was formed in September 2002, when FLDS Church president Warren Jeffs excommunicated Winston Blackmore, who was Bishop of the Bountiful, British Columbia group of the FLDS Church for two decades.  About 700 people continue to follow Blackmore, while about 500 follow Jeffs.
=== Latter Day Church of Christ (Davis County Cooperative Society or Kingston Group) ===
The Davis County Cooperative Society, known internally as "the Order" short for "the United Order," has a religious arm officially known as the Latter Day Church of Christ. The group is estimated to have approximately 3500-5000 members. This co-operative runs several businesses, including pawnshops and restaurant supply stores.
=== Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a group of approximately 100 to 200 people; most live near Modena, Utah, or Tonopah, Nevada. The Righteous Branch was organized in 1978 by Gerald Peterson Sr., who claimed that he was ordained a High Priest Apostle by AUB leader Rulon C. Allred. Later, after he was murdered, Rulon C. Allred appeared to him as an angel to instruct him to  preside over the keys of the priesthood. This church has built a pyramid-shaped temple and Gerald Peterson Jr. is their current leader. Like the AUB they are modern in their dress and do not allow girls under 18 to be married.
=== True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days ===
The True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days (TLC) is headquartered in Manti, Utah. Membership is estimated at 300 to 500. Organized in 1994, the TLC was a new "restoration" for the "very last days" before the Second Coming of Jesus. While the church initially grew rapidly, it has since stagnated and declined in numbers and converts since it ceased missionary efforts in 2000.
=== Centennial Park group ===
About 1,500 people are members of a group located in Centennial Park, Arizona, called The Work of Jesus Christ. In the early 1980s there was a conflict of leadership in the FLDS Church. Some of the members were very unhappy with the changes being made by various influential men in the community. When the FLDS Church abandoned leadership by council and instituted a "one-man rule" doctrine, those who wanted to maintain leadership by a priesthood council founded Centennial Park in 1986, approximately 3 miles (5 km) south of the twin communities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah. (Location of Centennial Park).
The name "Centennial Park" is a reference to the 1886 movement led by Lorin C. Woolley, which serves as the basis for fundamentalist claims of priesthood authority. Members of this group (referred to by members as "The Work") denounce all violence and abuse, do not permit marriage of young girls, and disavow the extreme practices of the FLDS Church. However, like the FLDS Church, they practice a form of arranged marriage. They dress in modern, modest attire.
The Centennial Park group has built a meetinghouse for weekly services and a private high school. A charter school was built in 2003 for the town's growing elementary-age population. About 300 members of this group live in the Salt Lake Valley, where they hold meetings monthly. Members living in Salt Lake City often travel to Centennial Park every month to help in building the community. This group is led by a Priesthood council.
The group was profiled on the ABC television program Primetime in a story entitled, The Outsiders, and also on The Oprah Winfrey Show.
=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Kingdom of God ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Kingdom of God is based in the Salt Lake Valley, and has around 200 members. The sect was founded by Frank Naylor and Ivan Nielson, who split from the Centennial Park group, another fundamentalist church. This group trace their authority through Alma A. Timpson and Frank Naylor.  The church is estimated to have 200-300 members, most of whom reside in the Salt Lake Valley. Most—if not all—of the members of this group were previously associated with the Centennial Park or FLDS Church. The group is also known as the "Third Ward" or the "Naylor group", after Frank Naylor.
=== School of the Prophets ===
The School of the Prophets has its headquarters in the Salem, Utah area. In 1968 Robert C. Crossfield published revelations he had received in the Book of Onias, which (among other things) chastised certain LDS Church leaders; he was excommunicated in 1972.  In 1982 Crossfield established a School of the Prophets, overseen by a president and six counselors.  Ron and Dan Lafferty (convicted of the July 1984 murder of their brother's wife and infant daughter) served for a month as counselors in the Provo, Utah School of the Prophets in March 1984. Four months after being removed  from the school, they committed their crimes. The continuing revelations were later named the Second Book of Commandments; it has 275 sections, dating from 1961 to 2018. (2BC Website) 
=== Independent Mormon fundamentalists ===
There is a small movement of independent Mormon fundamentalists. Independents do not belong to organized fundamentalist groups and do not generally recognize any man as their prophet or leader. Because Independents are not one cohesive group, they are very diverse in their beliefs and interpretations of Mormonism; therefore, their practices vary. Many Independents come from a background in the LDS Church, while others come from other Christian or Mormon fundamentalist backgrounds.
Independents rely on personal inspiration and revelation to guide them; there is no ecclesiastical structure among the Independents, although Independents often socialize with each other and may meet together for religious services.
Statistically, it is difficult to estimate how many Independents there are, but a recent estimate indicates that there may be more independent fundamentalists than there are in any one of the formally organized polygamous groups and may number as many as 15,000. According to this informal survey, about half of Mormon fundamentalists, both those in groups and those outside of groups, currently practice polygamy. There are many Independents in Utah, Arizona, Missouri and Brazil.
Two prominent figures among independent fundamentalists are the late writer Ogden Kraut as well as his plural wife Anne Wilde, both of whom maintained friendships with both independents and some members of the organized groups.

The Hydrogenophilaceae are a family of the class Hydrogenophilalia in the phylum Pseudomonadota ("Proteobacteria"), with two genera – Hydrogenophilus and Tepidiphilus. Like all Pseudomonadota, they are Gram-negative. All known species are thermophilic, growing around 50 °C, and use molecular hydrogen or organic molecules as their source of electrons to support growth; some species are autotrophs.
The genus Thiobacillus was previously considered to be a member in this family but was reclassified into the order Nitrosomonadales at the same time that the Hydrogenophilales were removed from the Betaproteobacteria to form the class Hydrogenophilalia.
Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus is a facultative chemolithoautotroph originally isolated from a hot spring; however, it was detected 2004 in ice core samples retrieved from a depth around 3 km within the ice covering Lake Vostok in Antarctica. The presence of DNA from (and potentially live cells of) thermophilic bacteria in the ice suggests that a geothermal system could exist beneath the cold water body of Lake Vostok, or simply that non-thermophilic strains of Hydrogenophilus exist and were present in the ice.
== Hydrogenophilalia ==
The class Hydrogenophilalia in the Bacteria was circumscribed in 2017 when it was demonstrated that the order Hydrogenophilales was distinct from the Betaproteobacteria on the basis of physiology, biochemistry, fatty acid profiles, and phylogenetic analyses on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene and 53 ribosomal protein sequences concatenated using the rMLST platform for multilocus sequence typing.
The class comprises one order, the Hydrogenophilales (type order), which contains thermophilic organisms - both autotrophs and heterotrophs, the former of which utilise molecular hydrogen as their electron donor, coupling its oxidation to the reduction of NAD+ with the enzyme hydrogenase. The very high proportion of ω-cyclohexyl fatty acids (specifically C19:0 cyclo and C17:0 cyclo) versus straight counterparts was a major distinguishing feature versus the Betaproteobacteria, and is probably involved in ensuring membrane stability at high growth temperatures. Members of the class can all use molecular oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor (i.e. are aerobic) as well as nitrate, which can be used by some members during denitrification. The autotrophic members of the class do not use carboxysomes to concentrate carbon dioxide or improve RuBisCO efficiency as a carboxylase versus an oxygenase. The dominant respiratory quinone of the class is ubiquinone-8 and menaquinones or rhodoquinones are not observed, though they are in the neighbouring Betaproteobacteria.

Lycium fremontii is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae, that is native to northwestern Mexico and the southernmost mountains and deserts of California and Arizona in the United States. It often grows in areas with alkaline soils, such as alkali flats.
Both its common name, Frémont's desert thorn, and its specific epithet, "fremontii", are derived from John C. Frémont.
== Description ==
Lycium fremontii is a bushy, spreading shrub approaching a maximum height of 4 m (13 ft) with many thorny, leafy branches. The fleshy leaves are oval in shape and up to 2.5 cm (0.98 in) long. Parts of the plant are coated in glandular hairs.
The inflorescence is a small cluster of tubular flowers roughly 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) long including the cylindrical calyx of fleshy sepals at the base. The flower is light to deep purple with purple veining. The corolla is a narrow tube opening into usually five lobes. The fruit is a red berry 6–8 cm (2.4–3.1 in) wide.

The semicollared hawk (Microspizias collaris) is a rare bird of prey species in the family Accipitridae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is potentially being affected by habitat loss.
== Taxonomy ==
Formerly placed in the genus Accipiter, it is the sister species of the tiny hawk (M. superciliosus). The latter was thought to be the only species in Accipiter yet studied which has a large procoracoid foramen. The collaris-superciliosus superspecies also differs from the typical sparrowhawks in other respects of its anatomy and as regards DNA sequence. Consequently, the old genus Hieraspiza may be more appropriate for them. In 2021, a phylogenetic study found it and the semicollared hawk to form a distinct group from the rest of Accipiter, that is sister to Kaupifalco. For this reason, both were reclassified into the new genus Microspizias.
It was formerly thought that the Accipiter collaris formed a superspecies with "A." superciliosus, but it was recently shown that A. superciliosus might not belong in the Accipiter genus. This called into question the traits of defining features of the Accipiter genus, putting Accipiter collaris and other species previously thought to be in the Accipiter genus in an unknown position.
Its current genus name, “Accipiter”, is Latin for “hawk”, its species name, “collaris”, is Latin for “collar”, or “neckband”
== Description ==
This is a small, rare hawk that lives in forests in mid elevations. It has black upperparts and a white band on the back of its neck. Its underparts are white, and it can have blotches on its sides. Young semi-collared hawks are more brownish. It usually stays in the forest and preys on smaller birds, occasionally soaring.
When calling to others, semicollared hawks create a high-pitched, almost whistle-like, sound. In addition, some semicollared hawks have been heard singing songs that consist of the repetition of a mid-pitch vvt-vvt sound. These songs also contain a series of four quick high-pitched calls that successively get higher.
== Distribution and habitat ==
This species is known to be non-migratory.
=== Colombia ===
The semicollared hawk is seen (although rarely) in the 600-1800m range in wet and humid forests, but seen more often in the Pacific slope in Antioquia, Valle, and Cauca, in the central Andes in Tolima and Cauca, in the eastern Andes in Norte de Santander, Santa Marta Mountains, and on the eastern slope of the eastern Andes in western Meta.
=== Ecuador ===
They are highly unlikely to live within the subtropical areas on the slopes of the Andes. Recorded from around 1,500-2,200 m, the semicollared hawk is only situated in western Napo and Zamora-Chinchipe on the eastern slope and Pichincha on the western slope. One has been spotted in Otanga, in northwestern Ecuador, at 1,900 m. This is neighboring the Mindo-Tandayapa area, where most other records of semi collared hawks have occurred.
=== Venezuela ===
Between 1,300-1,800 m in the humid montane forests in the Andes of Táchira, northwest Barinas, and Mérida, there have only been two claims of spotting this species. The semicollared hawk is extremely scarce in this region.
== Behavior ==
=== Diet ===
There is very little information on the feeding behavior of the semi-collared hawk, but In northern Colombia, a male was found with passerine feathers in its stomach. Another semicollared hawk was found chasing Dusky Bush Tanagers at Otanga in the western slopes of the Andes in northwestern Ecuador. These suggest that this species mainly, or only, feeds on birds.
=== Breeding ===
The generation length (average age before parenthood) of this species is 5.1 years.
== Predation and threats ==
Primarily due to agricultural expansion, forestry has declined. While this does not seem to currently affect the population, it may present a threat in the future.

Gyan Chauper (ज्ञान चौपड़ in Hindi sometimes spelt gyan chaupar) is a dice game derived from chaupar, a board game played in ancient India, popularly known as Snakes and ladders. It was from India that it spread to the rest of the world. It was a very popular game that was played not only for entertainment but also as a way to instruct on morality. The central concept of the game is the liberation from bondage of passions. So the players move from the lower levels of consciousness to higher levels of spiritual enlightenment and finally to Moksha.
== Board geometry ==
The Gyan Chauper board is in a grid pattern. The Hindu Gyan Chauper has numerous formats whereas the Jain Gyan Chaupers are standardized with 84 numbered squares in a 9x9 pattern. The board game is in the human shape-the universal being. The topmost part of the board is the heavenly abode or the Moksha dwar akin to the head of the cosmic being. A protruding square on the extreme bottom left and one square on each side of the board is indicative of its legs and arms. Even the way the snakes and ladders have been placed on the board does not change whereas they vary widely in Hindu, Muslim, and Buddhist Gyan Chaupers.
== History ==
Dice games have been played in India since Shramanic times, though game boards and pieces have been found in the Indus Valley civilisation. Ivory and bone objects of all shapes and sizes, some with dots on them, and interpreted as "dice" and/or "gaming pieces", have been found at Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Lothal, Kalibangan, Alamgirpur, and so on. Fragments of game boards have also been found at various sites. A potsherd with a chaupar design drawn on it has been discovered at Nagarjunakonda. A recent excavation from Rakhigarhi in Haryana discovered game boards and game pieces in terracotta and stone. Many pyramid-shaped game pieces made in stone, ivory and terracotta have been discovered at these ancient sites.
Dice playing is also mentioned in a hymn in the Rig Veda, which expresses the lament of the player over his loss of wealth and spouse. The Vedic people used Vibhidaka (small brown nuts) as dice. This tradition of ritualistic gambling is still seen today as Hindus play the modern version of this game during Diwali.
The Mahabharata also mentions the game of dice in which Yudhishthira loses everything to his cousins. The Skanda Purana mentions Shiva and Parvati playing a game of dice. This scene has been beautifully shown in a sculpture in the Ellora Caves in Aurangabad.
The Jain gyan chauper is mentioned in the Dhanapala, a 10th-century text from Rishabhapanchashika. It was mostly played on painted cloth called patas.
Gyan Chauper reached England around the 1890s. In the beginning, the game was also moralistic like the Indian version, but later due to the slowdown of the European economy in the 1940s due to the wars only numerical plan game boards were made. This design since then has remained ubiquitous.
== Gameplay ==
Gyan chauper influenced the creation of morality games such as "Virtue Rewarded and Vice Punished" (1918) which evolved during the British Raj into the English game of Snakes and Ladders. It is played with the same rules except here the idea behind it is how an individual's karma effects his spiritual journey. Therefore, each player the jiva progresses upwards overcoming hurdles in the form of snakes representing vices.
Each player starts from the bottom Narak Dwar and takes turns to roll dice and moves forward according to the number generated, towards Swarg (heaven) & ultimately reaching their goal of uniting with the Supreme One, seen as a crescent shape right on top.
== Specific versions ==
The Hindu version of the Gyan Chauper was more popular with the Brahmins.  Traditional Hindu gyan chaupars boards have greater diversity in terms of the format than those of Jains.  These formats are supposed to have developed over a period of time.  The terminologies included on the board are Sankhya, Yoga, Vedanta, all underlining devotionalism.  Vaikuntha (the heaven of Vishnu) being the winning square in most of the Hindu boards point to the fact that these boards were mostly Vaishnava in inspiration.  Some of the Hindu boards following the 9×8 pattern, i.e., 72 squares in all, are found in Nepal as well where it is referred to as nagapasa or snake-dice.  Surprisingly, both Persian and Devanagari script have been used in the squares.  In one of the board games of early 19th-century from Marwar, Vishnu is shown in the form of Krishna.  There is also a unique example of a 124-square board from Maharashtra.  Another notable feature of this board is the unusual 14×10 grid, the whole playing area being divided into four separate zones.
The Muslim version was used in the Mughal period from the late 17th or early 18th century. It is 100 square gyan chauper which represents the number of names of god or 101, if the throne of Allah is counted. It is written in Arabic or Persian. There are 17 ladders and 13 snakes. It shows direct ladders from fana fi Allah to the throne. Later with slight modifications, it is known as "Shatranj-al-Arifin" or "The chess of gnostics.
The Gyan Chauper exhibited at the National Museum, New Delhi is the Jain version with 84 squares.
== Modern Uses ==
The game has also been adapted for play on a phone application.

The OpenForum  was a six-hundred-delegate, three-day conference held in the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) in Cape Town, South Africa, in May 2012. The aim of the OpenForum was to bring a variety of thought leaders and activists to discuss the inherent paradoxes of societal inequality in Africa focusing on the three interlinking areas of money, power and sex. The event was hosted by the four Open Society Africa Foundations, which are under the umbrella of George Soros's Open Society Foundations.
== Overview ==
Each day of the OpenForum was dedicated to one of the key themes of Money, Power or Sex. Though the themes are inextricably interlinked Day 1 focussed on Money, Day 2 on Power and Day 3 on Sex. The OpenForum included major plenary debates and high-powered discussions as well as numerous smaller sessions highlighting innovative ideas and approaches.

City Connection is a 1985 platform game developed and published as an arcade video game by Jaleco. It was released in North America by Kitkorp as Cruisin'. The player controls Clarice in her Honda City hatchback and must drive over elevated roads to paint them. Clarice is pursued by police cars, which she can stun by hitting them with oil cans. The design was inspired by maze chase games like Pac-Man (1980) and Make Trax (1981).
City Connection was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, MSX, and ZX Spectrum. In Japan, the game has maintained a loyal following, and the NES version is seen as a classic for the platform. It was re-released in several Jaleco game collections and services such as the Wii Virtual Console. These received mixed responses in North America, with critics disliking its simplicity, lack of replay value, and poor controls. Some felt it possessed a cute aesthetic and unique concept and was entertaining. Clarice is one of the first female protagonists in a console game.
Jaleco released a sequel, City Connection Rocket, for Japanese mobile phones in 2004.
== Gameplay ==
In City Connection, the player controls Clarice, a blue-haired teen driving an orange Honda City hatchback, as she travels around the world in the quest of finding herself the perfect man. Clarice traverses through twelve side-scrolling stages that take place within famous locations around the world, including New York, London, and Japan. To clear these levels, the player must drive over each of the elevated highways to change their color from white to green. The car can jump over large gaps to reach higher sections of the stage.
Clarice is constantly being pursued by police cars that follow her around the stage, and must also avoid flag-waving cats that block her from moving past them. Clarice can collect and launch oil cans at police cars and traffic vehicles to temporarily stun them; ramming into them while stunned will knock them off the stage. Cats are invulnerable to oil cans, and cannot be killed by any means. If the player remains on the same stage for an extended period of time, spikes extrude from the ground and instantly kills them. On occasion, a red-colored balloon may appear in the stage, and collecting three of these warps the player to a new area and grants them bonus points.
=== Stages ===
== Development and release ==
City Connection was developed by Jaleco and released in Japanese arcades in July 1985. In North America, the game was licensed to Kitkorp and published as Cruisin'. Many of the game's stages feature an arrangement of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. The song used when Clarice hits one of the flag-waving cats is "Flohwalzer", known in Japan as "Neko Funjatta" (lit. "I Stepped on the Cat"), while another stage features a remix of the song "Highway Star" by Deep Purple. City Connection is credited as being one of the first to use new music tracks for each stage as opposed to recycling one song. The car the player controls throughout the game is a Honda City hatchback, which is believed to be the source for the game's title. Jaleco based the game's concept on Namco's Pac-Man (1980) and Alpha Denshi's Make Trax (1981).
City Connection was ported to several consoles, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), ZX Spectrum, and MSX. The NES version, which was Jaleco's first release for the system in North America, replaces Clarice with an unnamed male protagonist (though the Famicom release does feature Clarice), alongside other minor differences. The Japanese Family Computer (Famicom) version is included in the compilations Jaleco Collection Vol. 1 (2003) for PlayStation and JaJaMaru Jr. Denshoki Jaleco Memorial (2004) for Game Boy Advance. Both the NES and Famicom versions were digitally re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2008, and the 3DS and Wii U Virtual Console in 2013. A version for Japanese cellular phones was published in 2002 through i-Mode devices. Mediakite produced a port of the arcade game for Windows in 2003, while Jaleco produced a remake titled City Connection DX for mobile phones in Japan. Hamster Corporation released a digital version of the game under their Arcade Archives series for the PlayStation 4 in 2014, and for the Nintendo Switch in 2018. The NES version is also available through the Nintendo Switch Online service.
== Reception ==
City Connection has maintained a loyal following in Japan, where it became one of Jaleco's most successful and beloved games. The NES version, in particular, is viewed as a classic title on the system for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original. In 2003, Yuge listed it as being among the console's greatest games, through its unique gameplay, colorful visuals, and memorable soundtrack. The magazine staff described it as being a game that fulfills the dreams of children who want to play arcade games.
The NES version and its digital re-releases received mixed reviews in North America, by comparison. Critics focused largely on its overall simplicity and poor controls. A reviewer for Computer Entertainment US felt that the game was hindered by its lack of replay value for older players. IGN and Nintendo Life reviewers Lucas M. Thomas and Marcel van Duyn respectively both believed the game didn't age well and was too simplistic; Duyn described it as being "still well below par" compared to other NES ports of classic arcade games. Agreeing with them was Nintendo Life's Steve Bowling (now part of Good Vibes Gaming with Ashton Paulsen (Rob Paulsen's Son), and Derrick Bitner), who claimed the Wii U version was a shallow conversion of an arcade game he considered "already lost to the ages", specifically for its ill-conceived controls.
Critics felt City Connection, in spite of its flaws, possessed a cute aesthetic and unique gameplay. Computer Entertainer US believed its cute visual style would appeal to younger players and its challenge to older ones, and said what little the game had to offer was enjoyable. Christopher Michael of AllGame likened its gameplay to Pac-Man and similar maze-chase arcade games from the era, writing that its graphics and gameplay made it a must-play for the platform. Reviewing for Eurogamer, Dan Whitehead compared its gameplay to Q*Bert and its horizontal-scrolling to Defender, and made for an addictive game that justified its price tag. Thomas and Duyn agreed that City Connection's gameplay was simplistic and enjoyable, though constrained by its controls and high difficulty.
== Legacy ==
Clarice is credited as being among the first female protagonists in a console game. She appears as a playable character in the PlayStation game GUNbare! Game Tengoku (1998), misspelled as "Claris" and bearing little resemblance to her original design, and in the high-definition remaster The Game Paradise Crusin' Mix (2018) as downloadable content.
In 2004, Jaleco released a sequel named City Connection Rocket for Japanese mobile phones through i-Mode. The game places Clarice in the role of a spy working for a secret organization to capture criminal leaders from around the world. Rather than painting sections of road, Clarice must now collect briefcases placed in specific areas in each stage while avoiding police cars and other types of enemies. Rocket was bundled with City Connection DX for a 2015 re-release on the PlayStation Vita under Hamster's Appli-Archives series, which was available through the PlayStation Mobile service. PlayStation Mobile closed in September 2015, delisting the game from the PlayStation Store and other supported devices.
The company City Connection, who is the current owner of Jaleco's video game assets, is named after the game.

Dynamic load testing (or dynamic loading) is a method to assess a pile's bearing capacity by applying a dynamic load to the pile head (a falling mass) while recording acceleration and strain on the pile head. Dynamic load testing is a high strain dynamic test which can be applied after pile installation for concrete piles. For steel or timber piles, dynamic load testing can be done during installation or after installation.
The procedure is standardized by ASTM D4945-00 Standard Test Method for High Strain Dynamic Testing of Piles. It may be performed on all piles, regardless of their installation method.  In addition to bearing capacity, Dynamic Load Testing gives information on resistance distribution (shaft resistance and end bearing) and evaluates the shape and integrity of the foundation element.
The foundation bearing capacity results obtained with dynamic load tests correlate well with the results of static load tests performed on the same foundation element.

This is a list of churches in the United Reformed Church denomination in the United Kingdom. In 1972, the Presbyterian Church of England united with the Congregational Church in England and Wales to form the United Reformed Church (URC).
The 2022 General Assembly report wrote, "As a denomination, we are a small fraction of who and what we were in 1972 – we have about a fifth of the membership we had on our formation, and the number of churches has fallen from a little over 2,000 to a little under 1,300. We have about three-fifths the number of churches compared with one-fifth of the membership. These churches are served by 390 Ministers (Stipendiary and Non-Stipendiary), compared to 1,844 in 1972. Again, the ‘workforce’ of Ministers of Word and Sacrament is about one-fifth of the number 50 years ago."

Bob Schwalberg (October 12, 1927 – October 8, 1996) was an American photojournalist and writer on photographic technique and equipment.
== Career ==
Schwalberg was a photojournalist who worked for PIX Publishing, an early New York City photo agency which from 1935 to 1969 supplied news and feature photos to magazines, especially Life and, later, Sports Illustrated.
From 1950 he was a writer of technical stories in Popular Photography magazine and for many years produced a regular column for the magazine. He became known as Mr. Leica, an expert on camera equipment, having worked for the manufacturer of E.Leitz GmbH in Wetzlar in their public relations and  product design departments for nearly 7 years, and as a European correspondent, before returning to write for Popular Photography.
== Recognition ==
Two of Schwalberg's photographs were included by curator Edward Steichen in the world-touring The Family of Man exhibition, seen by 9 million viewers. In one, two women spectators at a sports event, photographed at close range, scream ecstatically while the surrounding men remain unmoved. The second, a policeman photographed from above and panned at a slow shutter speed as he walked, shows only his dark uniform against the slightly blurred pavement in an abstract representation of the presence of the law.
== Death and legacy ==
Schwalberg died a few days before his 69th birthday and was remembered at a memorial on March 4, 1997, at the Metropolitan Center, 123 West 18th Street, New York City.

Suha (pronounced [ˈsuːxa]; German: Zauchen) is a village just outside Škofja Loka in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. It is an old settlement, with its earliest mention in documents dating to AD 973.
== Church ==
There are a number of interesting architectural monuments in the centre of the village, but Suha is best known for its parish church (until 1975 belonging to the Parish of Škofja Loka) dedicated to John the Baptist. It has a Gothic star-vaulted chancel. Frescos from the mid-15th century survive, painted by the unnamed painter known as the Master of Suha, known to have worked in a number of other local churches, but named after his work in this church because it is one of the best examples of his work. There are also 16th-century frescos by Jernej of Loka in the church. The well-preserved frescos are some of the most important in Slovenia and the church has been listed as a monument of national importance.
== Notable people ==
Notable people that were born or lived in Suha include:
Andrej Glavan (1943–), the Bishop of Novo Mesto, the first parish priest of the Parish of Suha
Janez Kalan (1868–1945), priest, editor, and writer
Ahacij Stržinar (a.k.a. Achatius Sterschiner, 1676–1741), priest and religious writer

Major General Frederick Conyers Cotton  (30 July 1807 – 12 October 1901) was a British army officer who was posted in the Madras Presidency. He was among the first to introduce forestry practices into southern India. He collected wild plants in southern India and the genus Cottonia was named after him.
== Life and work ==
Cotton was the son of Henry Calveley Cotton and Matilda Lockwood. He was born in Southstoke, Oxfordshire. His siblings included Arthur Cotton and Sydney Cotton. He joined the Madras Infantry in 1825. On sick leave he went to the Cape of Good Hope and travelled around southern Africa in Kuruman where he met Robert Moffatt. In 1838 he travelled to Norway, Russia and America. In southern India, he initially worked in the public works department. He served in China during the First Opium War 1841–42 and was made a brevet major on the recommendation of his commanding officer Sir Hugh Gough. He became a full major in 1847 and on returning to India he was put in charge of engineering in Malabar and Canara. He was also involved in supervising the irrigation works started by his brother Sir Arthur Cotton in the Godavari. He spent summer in Ootacamund where he had a cottage named Woodcot. He married Mary Cunliffe, daughter of Brooke Cunliffe and Mary Pirrie in 1849 at Galle. He had an interest in gardening and had a greenhouse beside his Ooty cottage. Around 1847 he had noted that timber contractors for the Bombay Dockyard were damaging the forests between Coimbatore and Cochin and suggested that the British government take up management of the forests on their own. This was first put under the command of Cotton and later under Colonel James Michael who worked the Anamalais area. Cotton also examined wild plants and an orchid that he collected and sent to Robert Wight was named after him as Cottonia peduncularis. Wight described Cotton as an "an indefatigable collector." Cotton took an interest in plants and in their scientific cultivation. He planted Eucalyptus globulus trees in 1848 at his Ooty home and at Gayton Park (said to be the oldest Eucalyptus in Ootacamund) which were said to be 150 feet tall in 1908. In 1866 he gave a report on the army stations in southern India, particularly those on the Nilgiris. After retirement he lived in Ealing Green with his wife. He became a vice chairman at the Royal Society of Art and in 1878 he was involved in organizing a congress on the water resources in England. He was made Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1889. He read widely in natural history but was prevented in later life by poor eyesight.

St. Nicholas–Șelari Church (Romanian: Biserica Sfântul Nicolae–Șelari) is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 16 Blănari Street in the Lipscani district of Bucharest, Romania. It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas.
A first church, likely of wood, existed in the vicinity in the 17th or even the 16th century. It is attested in a 1664 document, and mentioned in records from subsequent decades. The church was rebuilt in masonry in 1699–1700; the main ktetor was Paharnic Șerban II Cantacuzino. Severely damaged during the 1802 earthquake, it was rebuilt in a different form over the following two years. In the mid-19th century, it was the church of the chandlers’, cotton-weavers’ and barbers’ guilds. After being badly damaged by the Great Fire of Bucharest, it was demolished in 1860. The rubble of the old church was reused, forming a wall up to four meters thick.
Work on the new church proceeded slowly. In 1867, when Prince Carol visited, he was shown the difficult situation and promptly promised a donation from his personal funds. His grant of ten thousand gold coins made the prince a ktetor. The interior painting by Gheorghe Tattarescu dates to the same period. The general aspect of the church, with its Greek- and Gothic Revival touches, goes back to the 1866-1868 rebuilding. Repairs took place in 1903, 1921–1925, 1940, 1971 and, following the appearance of serious cracks due to the 1977 quake, in 1978–1985. Archaeological observations in 1996 determined that the remains of the  Cantacuzino church are embedded in the foundation, some three meters below ground.
The church is cross-shaped, measuring 25 meters long by 9–16 meters wide. The polygonal Christ Pantocrator dome sits atop the nave, while the octagonal bell tower is above the outer part of the narthex. The altar apse has nine exterior faces, like its 1700 predecessor, and is semicircular on the interior. The facades, which feature a richly decorated cornice, are divided into two sections by a row of bricks. The large lower windows are rectangular, while the upper ones are arched. The western facade features upper and lower pilasters in strong relief, a central recessed rose window, a small triangular pediment and a cornice with palmettes. Four steps lead to a portico framed by an arch supported on two marble columns.
The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

Glottalized clicks are click consonants pronounced with closure of the glottis. All click types (alveolar ǃ, dental ǀ, lateral ǁ, palatal ǂ, retroflex ‼, and labial ʘ) have glottalized variants. They are very common: All of the Khoisan languages of Africa have them (the Khoe, Tuu, and Kx'a language families, Sandawe, and Hadza), as does Dahalo and the Bantu languages Yeyi and Xhosa (though Zulu does not). They are produced by making a glottal stop (the catch in the throat in the middle of English uh-oh!), which stops the flow of air, and then using the front of the tongue to make the click sound in the middle of the glottal stop.
== Glottalized nasal clicks ==
In all languages which have them, glottalized clicks are nasalized, though a few have non-nasal glottalized clicks as well. Glottalized nasal clicks are formed by closing the glottis so that the click is pronounced in silence; however, the nasal passage is left open (the velum is lowered), and any preceding vowel will be nasalized. They are typically transcribed something like !’ or ŋ!’ or ŋ̊!’, and often !’ word-initially but n!’ between vowels. In Khoekhoe they are written with the single letters ǃ ǁ ǀ ǂ, in Juǀ’hõa, as ǃ’ ǁ’ ǀ’ ǂ’ with a preceding nasal vowel, in Sandawe as q’ x’ c’, in Hadza as qq xx cc, and in Xhosa as nkc nkx nkq. 
When full glottal closure is made, there is no nasal airflow during the click itself, and there is a period of silence after the click and before the pronunciation of the vowel. That is, they are pronounced [!͡ʔ], etc. In many languages, however, the glottal closure is not complete, in which case they are pronounced with accompanying voiceless nasal airflow and transcribed ⟨ŋ̊!ʔ⟩, etc. A more general transcription is ⟨ᵑ!ˀ⟩; superscripting the nasal and glottal components indicates that they are articulated simultaneously with the click and not adjacent to it.
Initially and in citation form, the nasal component may be inaudible. That is, in this position glottalized clicks differ from plain (tenuis) clicks in the gap between click and vowel (the voice onset time), and from aspirated clicks in that this gap is silent rather than noisy. In canonical form, a glottal stop occurs between the release of the click and the start of the following vowel. In practice, though, the glottalization often 'leaks', with a creaky-voiced transition into the vowel. However, in medial position or embedded in a phrase after a vowel the nasalization can usually be heard: any preceding vowel will be nasalized or the click will be prenasalized. This is somewhat similar to aspirated nasal clicks, though in the later case the nasal airflow continues through the click itself. In neither case is the following vowel normally nasalized, something which occurs with simple nasal clicks in languages like Gǀui.
== Ejective clicks ==
In a few languages—Gǀui, Taa, ǂ’Amkoe, and, in Miller's analysis, Yeyi—there is in addition a series of oral, non-contour glottalized clicks. These have been described as ejective in the cases of Gǀui and Taa, and Nakagawa (2006) transcribes the two series of glottalized clicks as glottalized ⟨k!ʔ⟩ (⟨ŋ̊!ʔ⟩ in earlier publications) vs. ejective ⟨k!’⟩. Miller (2011) treats them as differing in nasality rather than in the type of glottalization. Miller treats the glottalization in these clicks as phonation, so that both oral and nasal clicks occur with five phonations: tenuis, voiced, aspirated, murmured (breathy voiced), and glottalized.
== Other types of glottalized clicks ==
Other series of glottalized clicks have only been reported from two languages, Taa and ǂ’Amkoe. Taa distinguishes the singular and plural of many nouns via a voiceless vs. voiced initial consonant, and thus there are voiced and voiceless versions of the glottalized nasal and oral clicks. In the voiced versions the glottalization is delayed, so that the hold of the click is partially voiced or nasalized: that is, [ǃˀa] vs. [ᶢǃʔa] and [ᵑ!ˀa] vs [ᵑ!ʔa]. The release of the voiced glottal click is "creaky", as the voiceless nasal often is. In Miller's treatment of phonation, this is perhaps a morphological contrast superimposed on the basic five-phonation system.
== Preglottalized nasal clicks ==
A few languages also have preglottalized nasal clicks. These are pronounced like ordinary voiced nasal clicks, but are preceded by a very short period of prenasalization that has a glottal-stop onset. They are considered unitary consonants, and not sequences of glottal stop plus nasal click. They are reported from Taa, Ekoka !Kung, and ǂ’Amkoe. (Taa and Ekoka !Kung also have preglottalized nasals /ˀm, ˀn/.) In one dialect of Gǀui, glottalized nasal clicks before pharyngealized vowels have become preglottalized nasal clicks, perhaps under the influence of ǂ’Amkoe.

A secret service is a government agency, intelligence agency, or the activities of a government agency, concerned with the gathering of intelligence data. The tasks and powers of a secret service can vary greatly from one country to another. For instance, a country may establish a secret service which has some policing powers (such as surveillance) but not others. The powers and duties of a government organization may be partly secret and partly not. The organization may be said to operate openly at home and secretly abroad, or vice versa. Secret police and intelligence agencies can usually be considered secret services.
Various states and regimes, at different times and places, established bodies that could be described as a secret service or secret police – for example, the agentes in rebus of the late Roman Empire were sometimes defined as such. In modern times, the French police officer Joseph Fouché is sometimes regarded as the primary pioneer within secret intelligence. Among other things, he is alleged to have prevented several murder attempts on Napoleon during his time as First Consul (1799–1804) through a large and tight net of various informants.

Jai Chandiram (26 December 1937 – 11 May 2013) was a veteran media person and the former deputy director general of Doordarshan. She contributed greatly to the use of media in education and was instrumental in introducing its use at premier institutes like Central Institute of Education – NCERT, Indira Gandhi Open University (IGNOU), and the Asia Pacific Institute for Broadcasting and Development (AIBD) in Kuala Lumpur, among various other institutions.
== Education ==
Teacher's Training Diploma, Lady Irwin College, New Delhi, 1957; Studied Drama and Radio at Briarcliff College, New York; Bachelor’s of Science majoring in Broadcasting Television, School of Journalism and Communications University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 1961; Jai received her master's degree from the School of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, 1966.
== Career ==
Jai began her career as a producer in Doordarshan at the age of 24 in 1961, two years after the Television Division of the All India Radio was started. She worked as a temporary hand who was given charge of setting up India's school television broadcasts. She was one of the first TV professionals who had no radio background. Her main concerns were gender imbalance issues, children's education and distance learning. Since she had no predecessors to learn from at Doordarshan, her career was an inimitable journey in innovation. Doordarshan had a large audience base, and Jai looked at details, both big and small, to ensure that the programs were visually appealing and intellectually stimulating.
Later she would describe the extent of improvisation which was the norm: figuring out the exact 20-minute period when the light coming through the studio window was just right to go through the prism and demonstrate VIBGYOR, and supplementing studio lights for other programming with lights borrowed from her uncle’s car workshop."
In the mid 1970s, she worked for the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment in Ahmedabad (SITE), which took television to Indian village schools.
Jai was also a part-time actress off-Broadway and donned several other roles with apparent ease. Several of her admirers were impressed with her "grasp of issues and networking skills".
She was a jury member at NHK (Japan) and the IAWRT Awards.

Danielle Staub (born Beverly Ann Merrill; July 29, 1962) is an American television personality. In May 2009, she came to prominence after being cast in the reality television series The Real Housewives of New Jersey, as a main cast member for two seasons (2009-10), and afterward as a friend for three more seasons (2017-20).
== Early life ==
Staub was adopted and raised in Athens, Pennsylvania. She said in her autobiography The Naked Truth that multiple relatives sexually abused her, writing, "The memory goes back as far as 8 years old. By 11, I started fighting back."
== Career ==
In 2001, Staub briefly acted in an episode of All My Children. In 2009, Staub joined the cast of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, where she appeared in the first two seasons. After weeks of speculation, Bravo announced that Staub would not be returning to the show for season three, giving no reason.
In September 2010, she appeared on the Style Network comedy program The Dish. She acted in several sketches, including a surprise cold open where she tried to take over as the show's host after leaving the real presenter, Danielle Fishel, bound and gagged backstage. In 2011, Staub starred in a food-related reality series for VH1 called Famous Food, in which they would "[revamp] a restaurant from the ground up." In August 2017, it was announced that Staub would return to The Real Housewives of New Jersey, in a "friend of the housewives" capacity. She appeared as a recurring cast member for seasons 8, 9 and 10. On January 8, 2020, Staub announced her permanent departure from The Real Housewives of New Jersey.
In July 2020, Staub launched a podcast Absolutely Danielle.
In October 2023, Staub appeared as a surprise guest on House of Villains.
== Personal life ==
Staub has been married three times. She was married to Kevin Maher from 1986 to 1987, and to Thomas Staub, the father of her daughters Christine and Jillian, from 1993 to 2007. In May 2017, it was announced Staub was engaged to Marty Caffrey. The two wed in May 2018. In August 2018, it was announced the couple would divorce. Their divorce was finalized on February 21, 2019. 
In June 2010, her home in Wayne, New Jersey, which had been featured on The Real Housewives of New Jersey, was put up for sale. In June 2012, Staub filed for bankruptcy. As of the end of 2014, the property was listed as a short sale in connection with Staub's successful completion of a bankruptcy filing.
== Controversies and legal situations ==
During the first season of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, other participants in the reality show confronted Staub with Charles Kipps' book Cop Without a Badge, which recounted events that surrounded Kevin Maher, an undercover FBI informer, who had once been married to Staub; Cop Without a Badge also included an account of Staub's arrest. Known at the time as Beverly Merrill, Staub cooperated with authorities and received five years' probation. Staub had been arrested in June 1986, but she denied many of the other allegations Maher had made. Staub's autobiography The Naked Truth was released on May 25, 2010, and in it, she wrote that her arrest was a matter of "wrong place/wrong time."
In October 2009, Staub's ex-husband Kevin Maher sued her for defamation of character after allegations were made about him; it was settled out of court. In October 2010, Staub was sued again by Maher for making false allegations in her memoir The Naked Truth, after notifying the publisher Simon & Schuster, a lawsuit would be filed if the book was published.
In 2009, Staub pressed charges against Ashley Holmes, the daughter of fellow Housewife Jacqueline Laurita, for pulling out her hair extension at a fashion show in Wayne, New Jersey. In January 2010, Holmes, then 19, was convicted of assault and fined $189.

Hammons Field is a minor league baseball stadium located in Springfield, Missouri, with a capacity of 7,986 plus approximately 2,500 general admission seating. The facility, funded entirely by local businessman, hotel mogul and benefactor John Q. Hammons, is the centerpiece of the midtown development project, Jordan Valley Park, on the corner of Sherman Avenue and Trafficway Boulevard. Completed in April 2004, it is home to the Springfield Cardinals, the Texas League affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals as well as the Missouri State University Bears.
Hammons built the ballpark before he had a minor league team secured to play in the stadium, though he steadfastly assured local residents it would be the Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. He was ultimately able to persuade the Cardinals to purchase the El Paso Diablos franchise of the Texas League from the Brett Bros. and relocate it to Springfield. They became the Springfield Cardinals soon thereafter when the parent club ended its brief two-year affiliation with the Tennessee Smokies of the Southern League.
In February 2023, the city of Springfield purchased Hammons Field and its surrounding parking lots for $12 million with plans to spend $4 million on stadium improvements.
== Features ==
The stadium is unique due to its baseball specific outbuildings. The stadium currently has two large buildings just outside the right-field walls. The larger of the two serves as a fully furnished indoor practice facility complete with astroturf, batting cages, and a small diamond for drills. The smaller building serves as administration, including General Manager offices, as well as housing both home teams' clubhouses, a cardio workout facility, and the physical trainer's office.
The stadium is also furnished with 28 luxury box suites. Only two of the Press Box level suites were initially available for public use; the largest of the three served as a personal suite for John Q. Hammons until his death in 2013 at the age of 94.
Hammons Field also boasts one of the largest high-definition video boards in Minor League Baseball.
== Events ==
In 2004, 2007 and 2012, the venue hosted the Missouri Valley Conference baseball tournament.

Institutes of the Christian Religion (Latin: Institutio Christianae Religionis) is John Calvin's seminal work of systematic theology. Regarded as one of the most influential works of Protestant theology, it was published in Latin in 1536 at the same time as Henry VIII of England's Dissolution of the Monasteries and in his native French language in 1541. The definitive editions appeared in 1559 in Latin and in 1560 in French.
The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant creed for those with some previous knowledge of theology and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of church and sacraments to justification by faith alone and Christian liberty. It vigorously attacked the teachings of those Calvin considered unorthodox, particularly Roman Catholicism, to which Calvin says he had been "strongly devoted" before his conversion to Protestantism.
The Institutes is a core reference for the system of doctrine adopted by the Reformed churches, usually called Calvinism.
== Background ==
John Calvin was a student of law and then classics at the University of Paris. Around 1533 he became involved in religious controversies and converted to Protestantism, a new Christian reform movement which was persecuted by the Catholic Church in France, forcing him to go into hiding. He moved to Basel, Switzerland for safety in 1535, and around this time he must have begun writing a summary of theology which would become the Institutes. His Catholic opponents sought to tie him and his associates (known as Huguenots in France) to groups of radical Anabaptists, some of which had been put down by persecution. He decided to adapt the work he had been writing to the purpose of defending Protestants suffering from persecution from false accusations that they were espousing radical and heretical doctrines. The work, written in Latin, was published in Basel in March 1536 with a preface addressed to King Francis I of France, entreating him to give the Protestants a hearing rather than continue to persecute them. It is six chapters long, covering the basics of Christian creed using the familiar catechetical structure of the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the sacraments, as well as a chapter on Christian liberty and political theology. Soon after publishing it, Calvin began his ministry in Geneva, Switzerland.
The Institutes proved instantly popular, with many asking for a revised edition. In 1539, Calvin published a much larger work, with seventeen chapters of about the same length as the six chapters of the first edition. It includes many references to classical authors and Church fathers, as well as many additional references to the Bible. Calvin's epistle to the reader indicates that the new work is intended for theological students preparing for ministry. Four chapters were added in a third edition in 1543, and a 1550 edition was published with only minor changes. The fifth and final edition with which Calvin was involved, and which is used by scholars as the authoritative text, is 80% larger than the previous edition and was published in Geneva in 1559.
Calvin's theology did not change substantially throughout his life, and so while he expanded and added to the Institutes, he did not change their main ideas.
== Title ==
The Latin word "institutio", translated in the title as "institutes", may also be translated "instruction", as it was in titles of German translations of the work, and was commonly used in the titles of legal works as well as other summary works covering a large body of knowledge. The title of Desiderius Erasmus's Institutio principis Christiani (1516), with which Calvin would have been familiar, is usually translated The Education of a Christian Prince. The form of the short title of the first edition of Calvin's work, published in 1536 is Christianae religionis institutio. The full title of this edition may be translated The Institute of the Christian Religion, Containing almost the Whole Sum of Piety and Whatever It is Necessary to Know in the Doctrine of Salvation. A Work Very Well Worth Reading by All Persons Zealous for Piety, and Lately Published. A Preface to the Most Christian King of France, in Which this Book is Presented to Him as a Confession of Faith. Author, John Calvin, Of Noyon. Basel, MDXXXVI. In the 1539 edition, the title is Institutio Christianae Religionis, possibly to emphasize the fact that this is a new, considerably expanded work. This is followed by "at length truly corresponding to its title", a play on the grandiosity of the title and an indication that the new work better lives up to the expectation created by such a title.
== Contents ==
Institutes in its first form was not merely an exposition of Reformation doctrine; it proved the inspiration to a new form of Christian life for many. It is indebted to Martin Luther in the treatment of faith and sacraments, to Martin Bucer in what is said of divine will and predestination, and to the later scholastics for teaching involving unsuspected implications of freedom in the relation of church and state.
The book is prefaced by a letter to Francis I. As this letter shows, Institutes was composed, or at least completed, to meet a present necessity, to correct an aspersion on Calvin's fellow reformers. The French king, wishing to suppress the Reformation at home, yet unwilling to alienate the reforming princes of Germany, had sought to confound the teachings of the French reformers with the attacks of Anabaptists on civil authority. "My reasons for publishing the Institutes," Calvin wrote in 1557, "were first that I might vindicate from unjust affront my brethren whose death was precious in the sight of the Lord, and next that some sorrow and anxiety should move foreign people, since the same sufferings threaten many." "The hinges on which our controversy turns," says Calvin in his letter to the king, "are that the Church may exist without any apparent form" and that its marks are "pure preaching of the word of God and rightful administration of the sacraments."
Despite the dependence on earlier writers, Institutes was felt by many to be a new voice, and within a year there was demand for a second edition. This came in 1539, amplifying especially the treatment of the fall of man, of election, and of reprobation, as well as that of the authority of scripture. It showed also a more conciliatory temper toward Luther in the section on the Lord's Supper.
The opening chapter of the Institutes is perhaps the best known, in which Calvin presents the basic plan of the book. There are two general subjects to be examined: the creator and his creatures. Above all, the book concerns the knowledge of God the Creator, but "as it is in the creation of man that the divine perfections are best displayed", there is also an examination of what can be known about mankind. After all, it is mankind's knowledge of God and of what He requires of his creatures that is the primary issue of concern for a book of theology. In the first chapter, these two issues are considered together to show what God has to do with mankind (and other creatures) and, especially, how knowing God is connected with human knowledge.
To pursue an explanation of the relationship between God and man, the edition of 1559, although Calvin claimed it to be "almost a new work", in fact completely recast the old Institutes into four sections and 80 chapters, on the basis of the Apostles' Creed, a traditional structure of Christian instruction used in Western Christianity. First, the knowledge of God is considered as knowledge of the Father, the creator, provider, and sustainer. Next, it is examined how the Son reveals the Father, since only God is able to reveal God. The third section of the Institutes describes the work of the Holy Spirit, who raised Christ from the dead, and who comes from the Father and the Son to affect a union in the Church through faith in Jesus Christ, with God, forever. And finally, the fourth section speaks of the Christian church, and how it is to live out the truths of God and Scriptures, particularly through the sacraments. This section also describes the functions and ministries of the church, how civil government relates to religious matters, and includes a lengthy discussion of the deficiencies of the papacy.
== Translations ==
There is some speculation that Calvin may have translated the first edition (1536) into French soon after its publication, but the earliest edition which has survived is Calvin's 1541 translation. It was primarily intended for French-speaking Swiss, since very few copies were able to be smuggled into France. Some of these were publicly burned in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral soon after their publication. Calvin published French editions of the Institutes in 1541, 1545, 1551, and 1560. They follow the expansion and development of the Latin editions, but they are not strictly translations, instead being adapted for use by a lay readership, though retaining the same doctrine.
The French translations of Calvin's Institutes helped to shape the French language for generations, not unlike the influence of the King James Version for the English language. There are differences in translations of one of the more famous passages. First, from Calvin's 1560 French edition, Institution, III, 7:
Nous ne sommes point nôtres: que donc notre raison et volonté ne dominent point en nos conseils et en ce que nous avons à faire. Nous ne sommes point nôtres: ne nous établissons donc point cette fin, de chercher ce qui nous est expédient selon la chair. Nous ne sommes point nôtres; oublions-nous donc nous-mêmes tant qu'il sera possible, et tout ce qui est à l'entour de nous. Au contraire, nous sommes au Seigneur: que sa volonté et sa sagresse président en toutes nos actions. Nous sommes au Seigneur: que toutes les parties de notre vie soient référées à lui comme à leur fin unique.
The Institutes were translated into many other European languages. A Spanish translation by Francisco de Enzinas of the 1536 Latin text was published in 1540, before Calvin even published his first French edition. An Italian translation of Calvin's French text was made in 1557. Later translations were of the final 1559 Latin text: Dutch (1560), German (1572), Spanish (1597), Czech (1617), Hungarian (1624), and Japanese (1934). Scholars speculate that the seventeenth-century orientalist Johann Heinrich Hottinger translated it into Arabic, but this has not been confirmed. A complete translation by H. W. Simpson of the 1559 Latin text into Afrikaans was published in four volumes between 1984 and 1992, following an earlier abridged translation by A. Duvenhage in 1951.
In English, five complete translations have been published – four from the Latin and one from the French. The first was made in Calvin's lifetime (1561) by Thomas Norton, the son-in-law of the English Reformer Thomas Cranmer. The Norton translation of the passage above, Institutes, III, 7:
We are not our owne: therefore let neither our owne reason nor our owne will beare rule in our counselles and doinges. We are not our owne: therefore let us not make this the ende for us to tend unto, to seke that which may be expediét for us according to the flesh. We are not our owne: therefore so much as we may, let us foreget our selves and all things that our our owne. On the other side, we are God's: therefore let us live and dye to him.
In the nineteenth century there were two translations, one by John Allen (1813). The same passage in the Allen translation, Institutes, III, 7:
We are not our own; therefore neither our reason nor our will should predominate in our deliberations and actions. We are not our own; therefore let us not propose it as our end, to seek what may be expedient for us according to the flesh. We are not our own; therefore, let us, as far as possible, forget ourselves and all things that are ours. On the contrary, we are God's; to him, therefore, let us live and die. 
Also from the nineteenth century, the Henry Beveridge (1845) translation, Institutes, III, 7:
We are not our own; therefore, neither is our own reason or will to rule our acts and counsels. We are not our own; therefore, let us not make it our end to seek what may be agreeable to our carnal nature. We are not our own; therefore, as far as possible, let us forget ourselves and the things that are ours. On the other hand, we are God's; let us, therefore, live and die to him.
The most recent from Latin is the 1960 edition, translated by Ford Lewis Battles and edited by John T. McNeill, currently considered the most authoritative edition by scholars. The Battles translation of the same passage, Institutes, III, 7:
We are not our own: let not our reason nor our will, therefore, sway our plans and deeds. We are not our own: let us therefore not set it as our goal to seek what is expedient for us according to the flesh. We are not our own: in so far as we can, let us therefore forget ourselves and all that is ours. Conversely, we are God's: let us therefore live for him and die for him.
Calvin's first French edition (1541) has been translated by Elsie Anne McKee (2009) and by Robert White (2014). Due to the length of the Institutes, several abridged versions have been made. The most recent is by Tony Lane and Hilary Osborne; the text is their own alteration and abridgment of the Beveridge translation.
== Legacy ==
The Institutes overshadowed the earlier Protestant theologies such as Melanchthon's Loci Communes and Zwingli's Commentary on the True and False Religion. According to historian Philip Schaff, it is a classic of theology at the level of Origen's On First Principles, Augustine's The City of God, Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica, and Schleiermacher's The Christian Faith. (Schaff himself was an adherent of Reformed Christianity, which traces its roots to John Calvin.)

The Philippine Tackle Football League (PTFL), formerly known as ArenaBall Philippines (ABP), was an American football league in the Philippines. The last champions were the Wolves which won their second title and the Bandits held the most titles, winning four seasons.
== History ==
=== Season 1 ===
The league was inaugurated on December 12, 2009, by Bernardo “Dodi” A. Palma at the University of Santo Tomas Field. In April 2010, the first official game of the league's first season was played at the Marikina Sports Complex. The inaugural season was contested by four teams; the Bandits, Barracudas, Juggernauts and the Wolves.  The first season started initially with a 7-on-7 format utilizing 3 offensive linemen on offense.
The first champions of the league were the Bandits. The Bandits' running back and team captain, Will Yeh, was named MVP of the first season.
=== Season 2 ===
In season two, the league switched to a 9-on-9 format.  The Barracudas disbanded and were replaced by The Rebels.  The Bandits won its second championship beating the Juggernauts at the ArenaBowl 14–6. The Juggernauts' quarterback Paul Reyes was named MVP of the 2011 season.
=== Season 3 ===
By season 3, the league had moved onto the standard 11-on-11 format.  The Bandits and Juggernaut once met again at the championships in season 3 with the Bandits taking their third consecutive league championships scoring 25–8. The MVP of the 2012 season once again came from the Juggernauts, Johnny Babaran who plays as a running back.
=== Season 4 ===
The Bandits also won the 2013–14 season, again by beating the Juggernauts; 14–6.
=== Season 5 ===
In season 5, the Vanguards joined the league and the Wolves became the first team other than the Bandits to win the championship, which the former won over the later with the score 16–0. The Wolves' wide receiver, Ivan Klaric was named MVP of the 2014–15 season.
=== Season 6 ===
Matches of Season 6 took place at the PhilSports Complex. The Tigers and Renegades were the new two teams to join the league. The league has also been rebranded as the Philippine Tackle Football League (PTFL). The PTFL also has managed to strike a deal with Asian Television Content Corp. to air its games at IBC 13. The Tigers withdrew midseason.
By early December 2015, it was reported that all five teams of the league withdrew following a dispute regarding a canceled game and the financing of the league. A game was canceled reportedly following a $250 payment to Bernardo “Dodi” Palma, President of the league. The players of the teams were also reportedly the ones who paid the expenses of the league despite sponsorship funds received by the league.
The five teams decided to hold two canceled games and the championships outside the league's auspices.
Manila Wolves defeated the Manila Bandits at the final championship held at the Acacia field in Manila in December 2015 under the banner "Super Bowl I".
The league folded in December 2015. It was succeeded by the Philippine-American Football League which was organized in 2016.

Gay literature is a collective term for literature produced by or for the gay community which involves characters, plot lines, and/or themes portraying male homosexual behavior.
== Overview and history ==
Because the social acceptance of homosexuality has varied in many world cultures throughout history, LGBT literature has covered a vast array of themes and concepts. LGBT individuals have often turned to literature as a source of validation, understanding, and beautification of same-sex attraction. In contexts where homosexuality has been perceived negatively, LGBT literature may also document the psychological stresses and alienation suffered by those experiencing prejudice, legal discrimination, AIDS, self-loathing, bullying, violence, religious condemnation, denial, suicide, persecution, and other such obstacles.
Themes of love between individuals of the same gender are found in a variety of ancient texts throughout the world. The ancient Greeks, in particular, explored the theme on a variety of different levels in such works as Plato's Symposium.
=== Ancient mythology ===
Many mythologies and religious narratives include stories of romantic affection or sexuality between men or feature divine actions that result in changes in gender. These myths have been interpreted as forms of LGBT expression and modern conceptions of sexuality and gender have been applied to them. Myths have been used by individual cultures, in part, to explain and validate their particular social institutions or to explain the cause of transgender identity or homosexuality.
In classical mythology, male lovers were attributed to ancient Greek gods and heroes such as Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon and Heracles (including Ganymede, Hyacinth, Nerites and Hylas, respectively) as a reflection and validation of the tradition of pederasty.
=== Early works ===
Though Homer did not explicitly portray the heroes Achilles and Patroclus as homosexual lovers in his 8th-century BC Trojan War epic, the Iliad, later ancient authors presented the intense relationship as such. In his 5th-century BC lost tragedy The Myrmidons, Aeschylus casts Achilles and Patroclus as pederastic lovers. In a surviving fragment of the play, Achilles speaks of "our frequent kisses" and a "devout union of the thighs". Plato does the same in his Symposium (385–370 BC); the speaker Phaedrus cites Aeschylus and holds Achilles up as an example of how people will be more brave and even sacrifice themselves for their lovers. In his oration Against Timarchus, Aeschines argues that though Homer "hides their love and avoids giving a name to their friendship", Homer assumed that educated readers would understand the "exceeding greatness of their affection". Plato's Symposium also includes a creation myth that explains homo- and heterosexuality (Aristophanes speech) and celebrates the pederastic tradition and erotic love between men (Pausanias speech), as does another of his dialogues, Phaedrus.
The tradition of pederasty in ancient Greece (as early as 650 BC) and later the acceptance of limited homosexuality in ancient Rome infused an awareness of male-male attraction and sex into ancient poetry. In the second of Virgil's Eclogues (1st century BC), the shepherd Corydon proclaims his love for the boy Alexis. Some of the erotic poetry of Catullus in the same century is directed at other men (Carmen 48, 50, and 99), and in a wedding hymn (Carmen 61) he portrays a male concubine about to be supplanted by his master's future wife. The first line of his infamous invective Carmen 16 — which has been called "one of the filthiest expressions ever written in Latin—or in any other language, for that matter" — contains explicit homosexual sex acts.
The Satyricon by Petronius is a Latin work of fiction detailing the misadventures of Encolpius and his lover, a handsome and promiscuous sixteen-year-old servant boy named Giton. Written in the 1st century AD during the reign of Nero, it is the earliest known text of its kind depicting homosexuality.
In the celebrated Japanese work The Tale of Genji, written by Murasaki Shikibu in the early 11th century, the title character Hikaru Genji is rejected by the lady Utsusemi in chapter 3 and instead sleeps with her young brother: "Genji pulled the boy down beside him ... Genji, for his part, or so one is informed, found the boy more attractive than his chilly sister."
Antonio Rocco's Alcibiades the Schoolboy, published anonymously in 1652, is an Italian dialogue written as a defense of homosexual sodomy. The first such explicit work known to be written since ancient times, its intended purpose as a "Carnivalesque satire", a defense of pederasty,  or a work of pornography is unknown, and debated.
Several medieval European works contain references to homosexuality, such as in Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron or Lanval, a French lai, in which the knight Lanval is accused by Guinevere of having "no desire for women". Others include homosexual themes, like Yde et Olive.
=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
The era known as the Age of Enlightenment (the 1650s to the 1780s) gave rise to, in part, a general challenge to the traditional doctrines of society in Western Europe. A particular interest in the Classical era of Greece and Rome "as a model for contemporary life" put the Greek appreciation of nudity, the male form and male friendship (and the inevitable homoerotic overtones) into art and literature. It was common for gay authors at this time to include allusions to Greek mythological characters as a code that homosexual readers would recognize. Gay men of the period "commonly understood ancient Greece and Rome to be societies where homosexual relationships were tolerated and even encouraged", and references to those cultures might identify an author or book's sympathy with gay readers and gay themes but probably be overlooked by straight readers. Despite the "increased visibility of queer behavior" and prospering networks of male prostitution in cities like Paris and London, homosexual activity had been outlawed in England (and by extension, the United States) as early as the Buggery Act 1533. Across much of Europe in the 1700s and 1800s, the legal punishment for sodomy was death, making it dangerous to publish or distribute anything with overt gay themes. James Jenkins of Valancourt Books noted:
These sorts of coded, subtextual ways of writing about homosexuality were often necessary, since up until the 1950s British authors could be prosecuted for writing openly about homosexuality, and in the U.S., authors and publishers could also face legal action and suppression of their books, not to mention social or moral condemnation that might end an author's career.
Many early Gothic fiction authors, like Matthew Lewis, William Thomas Beckford and Francis Lathom, were homosexual, and would sublimate these themes and express them in more acceptable forms, using transgressive genres like Gothic and horror fiction. The title character of Lewis's The Monk (1796) falls in love with young novice Rosario, and though Rosario is later revealed to be a woman named Matilda, the gay subtext is clear. A similar situation occurs in Charles Maturin's  The Fatal Revenge (1807) when the valet Cyprian asks his master, Ippolito, to kiss him as though he were Ippolito's lover; later Cyprian is also revealed to be a woman. In Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer (1820), the close friendship between a young monk and a new novice is scrutinized as potentially "too like love". Sheridan Le Fanu's novella Carmilla (1872) was the first lesbian vampire story, and influenced Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Stoker's novel has its own homoerotic aspects, as when Count Dracula warns off the female vampires and claims Jonathan Harker, saying "This man belongs to me!"
A Year in Arcadia: Kyllenion (1805) by Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg is "the earliest known novel that centers on an explicitly male-male love affair". Set in ancient Greece, the German novel features several couples—including a homosexual one—falling in love, overcoming obstacles and living happily ever after. The Romantic movement gaining momentum at the end of the 18th century allowed men to "express deep affection for each other", and the motif of ancient Greece as "a utopia of male-male love" was an acceptable vehicle to reflect this, but some of Duke August's contemporaries felt that his characters "stepped over the bounds of manly affection into unseemly eroticism." The first American gay novel was Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania (1870) by Bayard Taylor, the story of a newly engaged young man who finds himself instead falling in love with another man. Robert K. Martin called it "quite explicit in its adoption of a political stance toward homosexuality" and notes that the character Philip "argues for the 'rights' of those 'who cannot shape themselves according to the common-place pattern of society.'" Henry Blake Fuller's 1898 play, At St. Judas's, and 1919 novel, Bertram Cope's Year, are noted as among the earliest published American works in literature on the theme of homosexual relationships.
The new "atmosphere of frankness" created by the Enlightenment sparked the production of pornography like John Cleland's infamous Fanny Hill (1749), which features a rare graphic scene of male homosexual sex. Published anonymously a century later, The Sins of the Cities of the Plain (1881) and Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal (1893) are two of the earliest pieces of English-language pornography to explicitly and near-exclusively concern homosexuality. The Sins of the Cities of the Plain is about a male prostitute, and set in London around the time of the Cleveland Street Scandal and the Oscar Wilde trials. Teleny, chronicling a passionate affair between a Frenchman and a Hungarian pianist, is often attributed to a collaborative effort by Wilde and some of his contemporaries. Wilde's more mainstream The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) still shocked readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters. Drew Banks called Dorian Gray a groundbreaking gay character because he was "one of the first in a long list of hedonistic fellows whose homosexual tendencies secured a terrible fate." The French realist Émile Zola in his novel Nana (1880) depicted, along with a wide variety of heterosexual couplings and some lesbian scenes, a single homosexual character, Labordette. Paris theater society and the demi-monde are long accustomed to his presence and role as go-between; he knows all the women, escorts them, and runs errands for them. He is "a parasite, with even a touch of pimp", but also a more sympathetic figure than most of the men, as much a moral coward as them but physically brave and not a stereotype.
=== 20th century ===
By the 20th century, discussion of homosexuality became more open and society's understanding of it evolved. A number of novels with explicitly gay themes and characters began to appear in the domain of mainstream or art literature.
Nobel Prize-winner André Gide's semi-autobiographical novel The Immoralist (1902) finds a newly married man reawakened by his attraction to a series of young Arab boys. Though Bayard Taylor's Joseph and His Friend (1870) had been the first American gay novel, Edward Prime-Stevenson's Imre: A Memorandum (1906) was the first in which the homosexual couple were happy and united at the end. Initially published privately under the pseudonym "Xavier Mayne", it tells the story of a British aristocrat and a Hungarian soldier whose new friendship turns into love. In Thomas Mann's 1912 novella Death in Venice, a tightly wound, aging writer finds himself increasingly infatuated with a young Polish boy. Marcel Proust's serialized novel In Search of Lost Time (1913–1927) and Gide's The Counterfeiters (1925) also explore homosexual themes.
British author E.M. Forster earned a prominent reputation as a novelist while concealing his own homosexuality from the broader British public. In 1913–14, he privately penned Maurice, a bildungsroman that follows a young, upper-middle-class man through the self-discovery of his own attraction to other men, two relationships, and his interactions with an often uncomprehending or hostile society. The book is notable for its affirming tone and happy ending. "A happy ending was imperative", wrote Forster, "I was determined that in fiction anyway, two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows ... Happiness is its keynote." The book was not published until 1971, after Forster's death. William J. Mann said of the novel, "[Alec Scudder of Maurice was] a refreshingly unapologetic young gay man who was not an effete Oscar Wilde aristocrat, but rather a working class, masculine, ordinary guy ... an example of the working class teaching the privileged class about honesty and authenticity — a bit of a stereotype now, but back then quite extraordinary."
In Germany in 1920, Erwin von Busse published a collection of short stories about erotic encounters between men using the pseudonym Granand. Promptly banned for "indecency", it was not republished until 1993 and only appeared in an English translation as Berlin Garden of Erotic Delights in 2022.
Blair Niles's Strange Brother (1931), about the platonic relationship between a heterosexual woman and a gay man in New York City in the late 1920s and early 1930s, is an early, objective exploration of homosexual issues during the Harlem Renaissance. Though praised for its journalistic approach, sympathetic nature and promotion of tolerance and compassion, the novel has been numbered among a group of early gay novels that is "cast in the form of a tragic melodrama" and, according to editor and author Anthony Slide, illustrates the "basic assumption that gay characters in literature must come to a tragic end." "Smoke, Lilies, and Jade" by gay author and artist Richard Bruce Nugent, published in 1926, was the first short story by an African-American writer openly addressing his homosexuality. Written in a modernist stream-of-consciousness style, its subject matter was bisexuality and interracial male desire.
Forman Brown's 1933 novel Better Angel, published under the pseudonym Richard Meeker, is an early novel which describes a gay lifestyle without condemning it. Christopher Carey called it "the first homosexual novel with a truly happy ending". Slide names only four familiar gay novels of the first half of the 20th century in English: Djuna Barnes' Nightwood (1936), Carson McCullers' Reflections in a Golden Eye (1941), Truman Capote's Other Voices, Other Rooms (1948) and Gore Vidal's The City and the Pillar (1948). In John O'Hara's 1935 novel BUtterfield 8, the principal female character Gloria Wondrous has a friend Ann Paul, who in school "was suspect because of a couple of crushes which ... her former schoolmates were too free about calling Lesbian, and Gloria did not think so". Gloria speculates that "there was a little of that in practically all women", considers her own experience with women making passes, and rejects her own theory.
The story of a young man who is coming of age and discovers his own homosexuality, The City and the Pillar (1946) is recognized as the first post-World War II novel whose openly gay and well-adjusted protagonist is not killed off at the end of the story for defying social norms. It is also one of the "definitive war-influenced gay novels", one of the few books of its period dealing directly with male homosexuality. The City and the Pillar has also been called "the most notorious of the gay novels of the 1940s and 1950s." It sparked a public scandal, including notoriety and criticism, because it was released at a time when homosexuality was commonly considered immoral and because it was the first book by an accepted American author to portray overt homosexuality as a natural behavior. Upon its release, The New York Times refused to publish advertisements for the novel and Vidal was blacklisted to the extent that no major newspaper or magazine would review any of his novels for six years. Modern scholars note the importance of the novel to the visibility of gay literature. Michael Bronski points out that "gay-male-themed books received greater critical attention than lesbian ones" and that "writers such as Gore Vidal were accepted as important American writers, even when they received attacks from homophobic critics." Ian Young notes that social disruptions of World War II changed public morals, and lists The City and the Pillar among a spate of war novels that use the military as backdrop for overt homosexual behavior.
Other notable works of the 1940s and 1950s include Jean Genet's semiautobiographical  Our Lady of the Flowers (1943) and The Thief's Journal (1949), Yukio Mishima's Confessions of a Mask (1949), Umberto Saba's Ernesto (written in 1953, published posthumously in 1975), and Giovanni's Room (1956) by James Baldwin. Mary Renault's The Charioteer, a 1953 British war novel about homosexual men in and out of the military, quickly became a bestseller within the gay community. Renault's historical novels The Last of the Wine (1956) — about Athenian pederasty in ancient Greece — and The Persian Boy (1972) — about Alexander the Great and his slave lover Bagoas — followed suit. A Room in Chelsea Square (1958) by British author Michael Nelson — about a wealthy gentleman who lures an attractive younger man to London with the promise of an upper crust lifestyle — was originally published anonymously both because of its explicit gay content at a time when homosexuality was still illegal, and because its characters were "thinly veiled portrayals of prominent London literary figures".
A key element of Allen Drury's 1959 bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning political novel Advise and Consent is the blackmailing of young US senator Brigham Anderson, who is hiding a secret wartime homosexual tryst. In 2009, The Wall Street Journal's Scott Simon wrote of Drury that "the conservative Washington novelist was more progressive than Hollywood liberals", noting that the character Anderson is "candid and unapologetic" about his affair, and even calling him "Drury's most appealing character". Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times in 2005:
For a public official to be identified as gay in the Washington of the 50s and 60s meant not only career suicide but also potentially actual suicide. Yet Drury, a staunchly anti-Communist conservative of his time, regarded the character as sympathetic, not a villain. The senator's gay affair, he wrote, was "purely personal and harmed no one else."
Drury later wrote about the unrequited love of one male astronaut for another in his 1971 novel The Throne of Saturn, and in his two-part tale of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten's attempt to change Egyptian religion—A God Against the Gods (1976) and Return to Thebes (1977)—Akhenaten's romance with his brother Smenkhkara contributes to his downfall. Tormented homosexual North McAllister is one of the ensemble of Alpha Zeta fraternity brothers and their families that Drury follows over the course of 60 years in his University novels (1990-1998), as well as René Suratt — villain and "bisexual seducer of students" — and the tragic lovers Amos Wilson and Joel. Assessing Drury's body of work in 1999, Erik Tarloff suggested in The New York Times that "homosexuality does appear to be the only minority status to which Drury seems inclined to accord much sympathy."
In Taiwan, during the martial law period (1949–1987), the Kuomintang government focused on strengthening Taiwan's industrial and economic power and reinforcing traditional Confucious values on society. The heterosexual image of the modern family dominated, and "public discourses of same-sex desire were almost non-existent." Nevertheless, Pai Hsien-yung's Jade Love (1960), "Moon Dream" (1960), "Youthfulness" (1961), and "Seventeen Years Old and Lonely" (1961) — novellas and short stories exploring male homosexual desire — were published in Xiandai Wenxue. He published "A Sky Full of Bright, Twinkling Stars" in 1969, which follows gay characters who frequent Taipei's New Park area and would appear in Pai's 1983 novel Crystal Boys. Crystal Boys is set in 1970s Taipei and covers the main character Li-Qing's life after he is expelled from school for engaging in sexual relations with his classmate Zhao Ying. It is commonly identified as "the first Chinese novel that depicts the life struggles in the homosexual community [and] grew out of the particular socio-historical environment of Taiwan in the 1970s."
Other works published in Taiwan in the early 1960s include Chiang Kuei's Double Suns (1961), with depictions of male homosexual desire, and Kuo Liang-hui's Green Is the Grass (1963), which follows two Taiwanese middle school boys who exhibit sexual and romantic desires toward each other. The status of Double Suns in the Taiwanese gay literature scene has been questioned since male homosexuality is not the main focus of the work. On this, Chi Ta-wei comments on its influence and significance in the history of homosexual literature in Taiwan, writing that "[t]o underestimate [the characters of Double Suns] and deem them 'not homosexual enough' is to truncate the history of literature and to regulate the ever-elusive homosexuality to a confined definition."
James Baldwin followed Giovanni's Room with Another Country (1962), a "controversial bestseller" that "explicitly combines racial and sexual protests ... structured around the lives of eight racially, regionally, socioeconomically, and sexually diverse characters." John Rechy's City of Night (1963) and Numbers (1967) are graphic tales of male hustlers; City of Night has been called a "landmark novel" that "marked a radical departure from all other novels of its kind, and gave voice to a subculture that had never before been revealed with such acuity." Claude J. Summers wrote of Christopher Isherwood's A Single Man (1964):
A Single Man more fully develops the context of gay oppression than do [Isherwood's] earlier novels ... To portray homosexuals as simply another tribe in a nation comprising many different tribes is both to soften the stigma linked to homosexuality and to encourage solidarity among gay people. And by associating the mistreatment of homosexuals with the discrimination suffered by other minorities in America, Isherwood legitimizes the grievances of gay people at a time when homosexuals were not recognized either as a genuine minority or as valuable members of the human community. Presaging the gay liberation movement, A Single Man presents homosexuality as simply a human variation that should be accorded value and respect and depicts homosexuals as a group whose grievances should be redressed.
George Baxt's A Queer Kind of Death (1966) introduced Pharaoh Love, the first gay black detective in fiction. The novel was met with considerable acclaim, and The New York Times critic Anthony Boucher wrote, "This is a detective story, and unlike any other that you have read. No brief review can attempt to convey its quality. I merely note that it deals with a Manhattan subculture wholly devoid of ethics or morality, that said readers may well find it 'shocking', that it is beautifully plotted and written with elegance and wit ... and that you must under no circumstances miss it." Love would be the central figure in two immediate sequels Swing Low Sweet Harriet (1967) and Topsy and Evil (1968) and also two later novels, A Queer Kind of Love (1994) and A Queer Kind of Umbrella (1995). In his controversial 1968 satire Myra Breckinridge, Gore Vidal explored the mutability of gender-roles and sexual-orientation as being social constructs established by social mores, making the eponymous heroine a transsexual waging a "war against gender roles".
In 1969, Taiwanese author Lin Hwai-min published "Cicada" in his short story collection of the same name, Cicada. "Cicada" follows the lives of several college students living in Ximending, Taipei, who explore and struggle with expressing homosexual desires for each other.
Though Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow (1973) was unanimously recommended by the Pulitzer Prize fiction jury to receive the 1974 award, the Pulitzer board chose instead to make no award that year. In 2005 Time named the novel one of its "All-Time 100 Greatest Novels", a list of the best English language novels from 1923 to 2005. Other notable novels from the 1970s include Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman (1976), Andrew Holleran's Dancer from the Dance (1978), and Tales of the City (1978), the first volume of Armistead Maupin's long-running Tales of the City series.
In the 1980s, Edmund White — who had cowritten the 1977 gay sex manual The Joy of Gay Sex — published the semiautobiographical novels A Boy's Own Story (1982) and The Beautiful Room Is Empty (1988). Bret Easton Ellis also came to prominence with Less than Zero (1985), The Rules of Attraction (1987) and later American Psycho (1991). Nobel Prize winner Roger Martin du Gard's unfinished Lieutenant-Colonel de Maumort, written between 1941 and 1958, was published posthumously in 1983. It explores adolescent homosexual relations and includes a fictional first-person account, written in 1944, of a brief tragic encounter between a young soldier and a bakery apprentice in rural France.
Colombian-born gay author Fernando Vallejo on 1994 published his semi-autobiographical novel Our Lady of the Assassins. The novel deals with the topic of homosexuality in a secondary way, but it is notable for being set in the context of a Latin American country where it is a taboo.
Taiwanese author Chu T'ien-wen's Notes of a Desolate Man (1994) is written from the first-person perspective of a Taiwanese gay man. Chu compiled the experience of gay men in various cultures as portrayed through media to construct the narrative of Notes of a Desolate Man. The novel has often been criticized by Taiwanese critics for its fragmentary structure and narrative, due to Chu's frequent use of quotations and references. Chu's "presumably heterosexual" and female identity has also inspired various different readings of the novel, as well as "a tension that has been used to serve very different sorts of sexual politics."
The following year, Chi Ta-wei published Sensory World (1995), which is composed of short stories are significant because of their explicit discussion of sex, sexuality, gender, transgender identity, and male homosexual desire. In 1997, Chi published Queer Carnival, which contains a detailed list of Taiwanese queer literature (covering themes of gay, lesbian, transgender, and other sexuality and gender identities).
In 1997, the short story "Brokeback Mountain" written by Annie Proulx was published. It would be later adapted into a critically acclaimed Academy Award nominated film in 2005.
The founding of the Lambda Literary Award in 1988 helped increase the visibility of LGBT literature.
=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, much of LGBT literature has achieved a high level of sophistication and many works have earned mainstream acclaim. Notable authors include Alan Hollinghurst, Michael Cunningham, Colm Tóibín, John Boyne, and Andrew Sean Greer. Greer, an openly gay man, won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for Less. LGBT themes have also become more visible in a growing body of high-quality young adult literature, with notable authors including Alex Sánchez, Stephen Chbosky, Shyam Selvadurai, Perry Moore, Adam Silvera, Benjamin Alire Sáenz, and David Levithan. Becky Albertalli's teen novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda was adapted into the feature film Love, Simon by 20th Century Fox, the first film by a major studio focused on a gay teenage romance. Casey McQuiston's Red, White & Royal Blue is another example of young adult gay and bisexual romantic fiction, and there is currently in the works a film adaptation by Amazon Studios.
== Gay pulp ==
Gay pulp fiction or gay pulps, refers to printed works, primarily fiction, that include references to male homosexuality, specifically male gay sex, and that are cheaply produced, typically in paperback books made of wood pulp paper; lesbian pulp fiction is similar work about women. Michael Bronski, the editor of an anthology of gay pulp writing, notes in his introduction, "Gay pulp is not an exact term, and it is used somewhat loosely to refer to a variety of books that had very different origins and markets"  People often use the term to refer to the "classic" gay pulps that were produced before about 1970, but it may also be used to refer to the gay erotica or pornography in paperback book or digest magazine form produced since that date.
== Speculative fiction ==
Homosexuality in speculative fiction refers to the incorporation of homosexual themes into science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres which together constitute speculative fiction. Such elements may include a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBTQ) character as the protagonist or a major character, or exploration of varieties of sexual experience that deviate from the conventional.
Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. During the pulp magazine era (1920s-1930s), explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. Then, according to Joanna Russ, in the more relaxed Golden Age of Science Fiction (1940s-1950s) the genre "resolutely ignored the whole subject" of homosexuality. Some writers were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work as the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s; however until the late 1960s few depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, or openly investigated sexual questions. After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 1970s, homosexuality gained much wider acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. By the 1980s, blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to most readers. In Lois McMaster Bujold's Ethan of Athos (1986), the titular "unlikely hero" is gay obstetrician Dr. Ethan Urquhart, whose dangerous adventure alongside the first woman he has ever met presents both a future society where homosexuality is the norm and the lingering sexism and homophobia of our own world. Uranian Worlds, by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, was compiled in 1983 and is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition, 1990), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.
As speculative fiction gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures, this freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.
James Jenkins of Valancourt Books notes that the connection between gay fiction and horror goes back to the Gothic novels of the 1790s and early 1800s. Many Gothic authors, like Matthew Lewis, William Thomas Beckford and Francis Lathom, were homosexual, and according to Jenkins "the traditional explanation for the gay/horror connection is that it was impossible for them to write openly about gay themes back then (or even perhaps express them, since words like 'gay' and 'homosexual' didn't exist), so they sublimated them and expressed them in more acceptable forms, using the medium of a transgressive genre like horror fiction." Early works with clear gay subtext include Lewis's The Monk (1796) and both Charles Maturin's  The Fatal Revenge (1807) and Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). Somewhat later came the first lesbian vampire novella Carmilla (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) by Oscar Wilde, which shocked readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters. There is even gay subtext in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) as the title character warns off the female vampires and claims Jonathan Harker, saying "This man belongs to me!" The erotic metaphor of vampirism, inspired by Carmilla, has resulted in numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly implying or explicitly portraying lesbianism.
James R. Keller writes that in particular, "Gay and lesbian readers have been quick to identify with the representation of the vampire, suggesting its experiences parallel those of the sexual outsider." Richard Dyer discusses the recurring homoerotic motifs of vampire fiction in his article "Children of the Night", primarily "the necessity of secrecy, the persistence of a forbidden passion, and the fear of discovery." With the vampire having been a recurring metaphor for same-sex desire from before Stoker's Dracula, Dyer observes that historically earlier representations of vampires tend to evoke horror and later ones turn that horror into celebration. The homoerotic overtones of Anne Rice's celebrated The Vampire Chronicles series (1976–present) are well documented, and its publication reinforced the "widely recognized parallel between the queer and the vampire."
== Comics ==
LGBT themes in comics is a relatively new concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBTQ) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of comic books and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children. With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US took the form of subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comics from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers.
Comic strips have also dealt in subtext and innuendo, their wide distribution in newspapers limiting their inclusion of controversial material. The first openly gay characters appeared in prominent strips in the late 1970s; representation of LGBT issues in these titles causes vociferous reaction, both praise and condemnation, to the present day. Comic strips aimed at LGBT audiences are also syndicated in gay- and lesbian-targeted magazines and comics have been created to educate people about LGBT-related issues and to influence real-world politics, with their format and distribution allowing them to transmit messages more subtle, complex, and positive than typical education material. Portrayal of LGBT themes in comics is recognized by several notable awards, including the Gaylactic Spectrum Award and GLAAD Media Awards for outstanding comic book and comic strip.
Since the 1990s, LGBT themes have become more common in mainstream US comics, including in a number of titles in which a gay character is the star. European comics have been more inclusive from an earlier date. The lack of censorship, and greater acceptance of comics as a medium of adult entertainment led to less controversy about the representation of LGBT characters. The popular Japanese manga tradition has included genres of girls' comics that feature homosexual relationships since the 1970s, in the form of yaoi and yuri. These works are often extremely romantic and include archetypal characters that often are not identified as gay. Since the Japanese "gay boom" of the 1990s, a body of manga aimed at LGBT customers has been produced, which have more realistic and autobiographical themes. Pornographic manga also often includes sexualised depictions of lesbians and intersex people. Queer theorists have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are usually shown as assimilated into heterosexual society, whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is emphasized.
== Children's fiction ==
=== Gay themes ===
Compared to gay and lesbian teen fiction, sales of gay-themed books for younger children, and availability of these books in public and school libraries, remain "very dicey and very different".
When Megan Went Away (1979) was the first picture book to include LGBT characters. The story, written by Jane Severance and illustrated by Tea Schook, concerns a preteen girl whose lesbian mother and her partner have separated. The first children's book with gay male characters was Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin. Originally published in 1981 in Danish as Mette bor hos Morten og Erik, it tells the story of Jenny, her father and his partner and their daily life. Controversy and politicization followed its publication.
Some of the best known children's books with gay themes include Heather Has Two Mommies (1989) and Daddy's Roommate (1991), published by LGBTQ publisher Alyson Books. Both books discussed same-sex parenting and attracted criticism and controversy. The American Library Association ranked Heather Has Two Mommies as the third and second most frequently challenged book in the United States in 1993 and 1994, respectively.
Recent controversies include King & King, originally written in Dutch and published in English in 2002. The book is about a prince uninterested in princesses, who eventually falls in love with another prince. In 2006, parents sued a Massachusetts school district after a teacher read the book to their son's second grade class. And Tango Makes Three (2005) by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell has been frequently challenged, and is often on the American Library Associations's List of Challenged Books for Banned Books Week. It was ranked ninth on this list in 2017. The book tells the true story of two male penguins who adopt an egg and raise the baby once it has hatched. While it has been banned and debated many times, it has been awarded and noted by the American Library Association on their Rainbow Book List.
In 2018, Little Bee Books partnered with media advocacy group GLAAD for a series of books that offered positive LGBT representation in children's literature. The partnership kicked off with Prince & Knight, written by Daniel Haack and illustrated by Stevie Lewis, which was named to the American Library Association's Rainbow Book List and was named a best book of the year by Kirkus Reviews, Amazon and the Chicago Tribune. The partnership has gone on to include books that also offer lesbian, transgender and gender non-conforming representation.
Australian titles include the books in the 'Learn to Include' series: The Rainbow Cubby House, My House, Going to Fair Day and Koalas on Parade. House of Hades (2013), Book 4 in the young adult series The Heroes of Olympus  by Rick Riordan, features a gay supporting character, Nico di Angelo.
A more extensive list of gay children's literature includes:
In July 2014, Singapore's National Library Board (NLB), a state-funded network of 26 public libraries, confirmed it would destroy three children's books with pro-LGBT families themes for being "against its 'pro-family' stance[,] following complaints by a parent and its own internal review". The decision was widely criticized by LGBT supporters and the arts and literary community who see the actions as akin to book burnings and other forms of censorship. The three books are And Tango Makes Three, which covers the true story of a pair of male penguins that successfully raise a chick, The White Swan Express, which features children adopted by a variety of families including gay, mixed-race and single parents, and Who's in My Family, which references families with homosexual parents. Two weeks after a gay rights rally, these books "sparked a fierce debate" between the religious conservatives, who opposed the rally, and Singapore's growing gay-rights lobby.
=== Bisexual themes ===
As of 2020, there have been no explicitly bisexual characters–either children or adults–in children's picture book fiction. While many nonfiction picture book biographies of historical figures who had relationships with people of the same gender overlook or ignore those relationships, at least one, Frida Kahlo for Girls and Boys by Nadia Fink (2017), mentions that Kahlo loved both men and women.  Some young adult fiction books do feature bisexual characters, including Empress of the World by Sara Ryan (2001), Double Feature: Attack of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies/Bride of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies by Brent Hartinger (2007), Pink by Lili Wilkinson (2009), and It's Our Prom (So Deal with It) by Julie Anne Peters (2012). When they do appear in young adult fiction, bisexuals are often portrayed as confused or greedy.

The former Arrowhead State Park, now known as the Arrowhead Area at Lake Eufaula State Park is a 2,200-acre (8.9 km2) Oklahoma state park area located in northern Pittsburg County, Oklahoma on a peninsula of Eufaula Lake.  It is located near the city of Canadian, Oklahoma.  Eufaula is one of the largest man-made lakes in the southwest. Arrowhead State Park features 100 tent sites and 91 total RV sites. The park also offers picnic shelters, a marina, playgrounds, trails, miniature golf course, swimming area, mountain biking, equestrian campground, stables, and 25 miles (40 km) of equestrian trails. Group camps with a kitchen and bunkhouses are available and can sleep up to 144 people. Area 51 Marina, which also offers a restaurant, is also located at the park in the Echo Ridge area.
Arrowhead State Park Golf Course is an 18-hole, par 72 course adjacent to Eufaula Lake. Originally part of the Arrowhead Lodge resort, the course was retained by the state when it sold the now-defunct lodge to the Federal government in 1983. It has well-maintained bent grass greens, Bermuda grass tees and fairways, sand bunkers and few water hazards. Related facilities are a putting green, pro shop and a driving range. The pro shop has carts and clubs available for rent, and also offers snacks and drinks. The course is open every day except Christmas, 7 A.M. to 7 P. M.
The park is 18 miles (29 km) north of McAlester, Oklahoma on U.S. Highway 69, then 4 miles (6.4 km) east on State Park Road.
== Fees ==
To help fund a backlog of deferred maintenance and park improvements, the state implemented an entrance fee for this park and 21 others effective June 15, 2020.  The fees, charged per vehicle, start at $10 per day for a single-day or $8 for residents with an Oklahoma license plate or Oklahoma tribal plate.  Fees are waived for honorably discharged veterans and Oklahoma residents age 62 & older and their spouses.  Passes good for three days or a week are also available; annual passes good at all 22 state parks charging fees are offered at a cost of $75 for out-of-state visitors or $60 for Oklahoma residents.  The 22 parks are:
Arrowhead Area at Lake Eufaula State Park
Beavers Bend State Park
Boiling Springs State Park
Cherokee Landing State Park
Fort Cobb State Park
Foss State Park
Honey Creek Area at Grand Lake State Park

== Narconon (Arrowhead Lodge) ==
At its opening, the park was home to a resort hotel, Arrowhead Lodge. The lodge was one of two lodges built in 1965 by the state on Eufaula Lake, the other being Fountainhead Lodge in present-day Lake Eufaula State Park. Initially operated by the state, financial losses led to the transfer of Arrowhead Lodge to the federal government in 1983 along with Fountainhead Lodge. The lodge was next sold to the Choctaw Nation in 1985, who operated a gaming hotel in the premises. In 2000, Arrowhead Lodge was sold to the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE) for use by Narconon as the new site for the Narconon inpatient drug treatment center then located near Newkirk, Oklahoma. The sale aroused controversy among local residents due to concerns about security and about the affiliation of ABLE and Narconon with the Church of Scientology. The privately operated Narconon facility, now known as Narconon Arrowhead, is surrounded by the state park.

Hong Kong Sceneway Plaza (Chinese: 滙景廣場; Jyutping: wui6 ging2 gwong2 coeng4) is a shopping centre in Lam Tin, Kowloon, Hong Kong. It also contains the East Kowloon Office of the Immigration Department. Opened in February 1992, the shopping centre is located adjacent to Lam Tin station of Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR). The plaza, which used to be a Japanese department store called Yaohan, contains many small stores including fashion, stationery, and music shops.
The complex has five floors, but only three are used for multiple retail outlets. One floor contains the offices of the Immigration Department and the bottom floor has only a bookstore (in addition to the escalator).
== Dining ==
Several Chinese tea restaurants are located near the public apartments in Lam Tin, and private estates are situated near Sceneway Plaza, resulting in a large number of dining establishments that range from cantonese restaurants to McDonald's. In addition, several unlicensed shops that serve cold noodles have opened. They had been monitored by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, but their low prices attracted a large number of students who tended to litter Sceneway Plaza with packaging materials, causing environmental problems. Yoshinoya opened in July 2006.
In July 2006, the Shanghainese restaurant was closed permanently. In August 2006, a Fairwood fast-food restaurant opened in its place.
In June 2010, Mr Cake, a cake and dessert specialist, opened on the fifth floor. They serve Hokkaido chiffon cakes, serradura, mango puddings, Taiwanese egg cakes and other desserts. Many of its products are unique to Sceneway Plaza and its surrounding area.
== Shops ==
Sceneway Plaza shops include the PARKnSHOP supermarket on the fourth floor.
== Public transport ==
Sceneway Plaza's main public transport is MTR and buses that pass the Eastern Harbour Crossing to most places in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.

The Professorship in Greek was one of the original professorships of University College London (UCL) in 1828.  The position was established at the same time as the Professorship in Latin.  The inaugural lecture of the first incumbent was delivered on November 1, 1830.  The teaching of classical Greek (and Latin) at the new University of London "challenged both the monopoly and the style of Oxbridge classics".  Since the Second World War the chair has been occupied by a series of renowned scholars including T. B. L. Webster (who founded the Institute of Classical Studies), Eric Handley, P. E. Easterling, Richard Janko, and Chris Carey. P. E. Easterling is the only woman to have held the position.

Wallflowers is an American comedy web series created and written by Kieran Turner. The series is broadcast on the internet and premiered on March 20, 2013 and ran for two seasons. The show was distributed independently on the internet before being streamed on Stage17.tv, and later Dekkoo.
== Premise ==
Four friends in New York City belong to a support group of adults who struggle with dating. The core group of characters are in their mid to late 30s and are from the last generation of people who did not come of age using the internet as a dating tool. The characters find themselves single and not very successful at getting dates.
== Characters ==
=== Main Cast ===
Bryce Hunter (Patch Darragh): A former child star turned casting director. Openly gay, Bryce is acerbic, closed off and wary of trusting people. He drinks and smokes to excess.
Daisy Loeb (Sarah Saltzberg): Bryce's best friend and partner at Hunter Casting. She works hard to balance her romantic tendencies with her no-nonsense outlook on life.
Martin Parrish (Gibson Frazier): Nearing 40, Martin is looking for the right woman to settle down with, marry and start a family. Unfortunately, his eagerness to do so rarely gets him a second date.
Janice Ackerman (Christianne Tisdale): A former back-up singer for many defunct bands no one remembers, Janice now dispenses relationship advice at a weekly meeting in NYC. She gives her all of herself to followers, whether they like it or not.
Jane Tavana (Jolly Abraham): The prodigal group member, now returned after being fired from her job as a high powered attorney and ending an affair with her married boss. Jane refuses to be caught in anything she can't get out of, to the point of self-sabotage.
Rhonda (Susan Louise O'Connor): Optimistic, romantic, loving, and a doormat, Rhonda refuses to see the negative in anything.
Linus (Max Crumm): Linus is the newest member of the group. A bartender and aspiring comic book artist, he's terribly inept at dating and has no clue just how attractive he is.
Victoria Pond (Angela Lin): Angry, defensive and devastatingly hilarious, Victoria was raised in a culture where women were seen to be subservient, and has fought against that her entire life. She surrounds herself with gay men and makes it very difficult to let anyone else in, for fear of losing her identity. (Season One only)
=== Recurring ===
Leslie (Marcia DeBonis): Office manager at Hunter Casting and the real muscle behind the team.
Becca (Jillian Louis): Casting assistant and rival of Daisy's for pretty much everything.
Wade (Daniel Abeles): New receptionist at Hunter Casting.
Alex (John Halbach): Musician who begins dating Bryce in Season Two.
Fred (Robert Bogue): Janice's ex-husband. A band manager and ne'er-do-well who begins dating Jane.
Tina (Tina Hart): Support group member
Ricky (Ricky Dunlop): Support group member
Todd (Gideon Glick): Receptionist at Hunter Casting and thorn in Bryce's side. He's fired from the agency at the beginning of Season Two. (Season One only)
Charlie (Matt Dengler): Daisy's younger brother who harbors a secret crush on Bryce. (Season One only)
Mark (Wayne Wilcox): Filmmaker and client of Hunter Casting. He and Daisy are infatuated with one another. Though Mark is a large presence in Season 2, he only appears as a hazy profile on a computer screen or is heard as a voice over the phone. This was due to actor Wayne Wilcox's unavailability during shooting. Actor Mark Provencher stepped in to do the brief bits in Season 2.
=== Notable Guests ===
Troy (Charlie Williams): Aspiring actor, boyfriend of Todd, and the worst casting reader on the face of the earth. (Season One)
Nancy (Lisa Joyce): Martin's pregnant co-worker, with whom he strikes up a friendship after volunteering to accompany her Lamaze classes. (Season Two)
Greg (Bryce Pinkham): Nancy's husband, a stand-up comedian on the road. (Season Two)
Dan Randall (Richard Gallagher): A filmmaker who offers Bryce a shot at a comeback. (Season 2)
== Production ==
Wallflowers was created and written by director-producer Kieran Turner, a graduate of the Tisch School of the Arts. Season One of Wallflowers was financed by Turner himself and released in April 2013 on Blip.tv and YouTube. The show was subsequently picked up for a fully funded 2nd season by online digital platform Stage17, which specialized in programming by the Broadway community (many of the cast of Wallflowers are working Broadway/theater actors). Season Two launched on April 3, 2014, three days after the launch of Stage17 itself.
Several cast changes had been implemented during the show's brief run. The character of Bryce Hunter was recast twice. Originally played by Tony nominee Chad Kimball, who was unable to continue with the series past Episode 3 of Season 1, the role was recast with actor Lucas Near-Verbrugghe. To introduce the switch, the show filmed a short piece which was a parody of the Steven Carrington/Dynasty actor swap, with the cast of Wallflowers gathered in a hospital room, awaiting Bryce's head bandages to be removed. Near-Verbrugghe relocated to Los Angeles at the end of Season 1, so the role was once again recast, this time with actor Patch Darragh, who filmed all of Season 2 and is the current Bryce Hunter.
In between seasons, the cast shot a series of "minisodes" in order to keep up viewer interest. There were seven "video dating" segments, each featuring a different cast member, and five installments of a new segment called "Ask Janice," an advice vlog by the show's resident relationship guru, Janice Ackerman. In an interview Turner stated where the inspiration came from for the series, "I became very excited by some of the newer web series I was seeing that were longer in format, were well-written, acted and directed and felt like actual TV shows. And any time I can find a forum to portray the kinds of characters I want to see that aren’t getting done elsewhere, I jump at it."

Ludwig-Wilhelm Tepper de Ferguson (Lewis-William Ferguson-Tepper, Tepper von Ferguson, Louis-Guillaume Tepper de Ferguson; 18 December 1768, Warsaw – 12 September 1838, Paris) was a Polish–Russian musician and composer, a music teacher mainly associated with the Imperial Lycée in Tsarskoye Selo (near St Petersburg, Russia).
== Biography ==
=== Origin of the family ===
Ludwig-Wilhelm Tepper de Ferguson was born in Warsaw as the sixth child and third son of the extremely wealthy Polish banker Piotr Fergusson Tepper and his wife Maria-Philipina, née Valentin d'Hauterive. The surname 'Ferguson' indicates the Scottish origin of the family. Indeed, in 1703, his grandfather William Ferguson of Inverurie had emigrated from Scotland to Poland. In 1714, William Ferguson married Katherina-Concordia Tepper, a sister of the wealthy and influential merchant and banker, furrier and fur trader Pjotr Tepper of Poznań. Pjotr Tepper managed the large-scale international trade using family connections, and imported goods to Poland from many countries, including Britain.
William Ferguson and Katherina-Concordia had three sons. One of them, Peter (1732–1794), who would become Ludwig-Wilhelm's father, entered into partnership with his maternal uncle Pjotr Tepper. In 1767 he was officially adopted by Pjotr Tepper on the condition he would add the name Tepper to his name Ferguson.
In 1779, the Scottish origin of Peter Ferguson Tepper was recognised and confirmed in England, in consequence of which the Scottish and Polish branches of the family re-established relations. According to a column of James Boswell in a later issue of The Scots Magazine (1786): "In June 1779, he [Peter Ferguson-Tepper] had his arms matriculated in the Herald Office, London, and obtained permission to use the surname and arms of Tepper jointly with the surname and arms of Ferguson. The father's writings being destroyed during the civil war in Poland, the son did not know from what part of Scotland his father came; and his Scots relations, not having heard from Poland for near fifty years, believed their friend in that country had died without issue; but the above paragraph in our Magazine caused them to make inquiry, when with equal joy they discovered other; and in a few months thereafter, Mr Ferguson Tepper came to Edinburgh to see them./.../Mr Peter Ferguson Tepper, of Warsaw is supposed to be the second banker in Europe. Mister Walter Ferguson, writer in Edinburgh, and he are brothers' children."
=== Early years ===
In 1763, Piotr Fergusson Tepper married Maria-Philippina Valentin d'Hauterive (c. 1736–1792), daughter of a French emigrant who left France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The 1770s–1780s were the time of their prosperity. The Tepper bank had partners in Holland, Italy, and Russia and undertook large-scale international financial operations. Among their clients were Russian aristocrats and the Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski, whose army they financed.  The splendid Tepper Palace in Warsaw was depicted in 1770 by Bernardo Bellotto.
In 1777, Piotr Fergusson-Tepper became Treasurer and Agent of the Maltese Order. In 1787, the Teppers entertained King Stanislaw-August Poniatowski in their county estate Falenty. Recent research has revealed the participation of the Teppers in Scottish politics of the time: after the death of Princess Charlotte (1753–1789), the illegitimate daughter of Charles Edward Stuart (1720–1788), the last Scottish Pretender for the English throne), the Teppers acted as guardians for her children. In the 1790s, the Teppers were granted the rank of Polish Nobility.
Along with his brothers and sisters, Ludwig-Wilhelm spent his early years in the splendour of his parents' palaces. He was an infant prodigy, and started to play the clavecin at the age of six; at ten he composed music and gave public concerts.
His father, however, intended him for law and diplomacy, and in 1781 sent him (together with two of his brothers) to study at the Military Academy of Duke Carl-Eugen in Stuttgart, where he resented the poor quality of music instruction.
From 1783 to 1789, he studied law, history and many other subjects at the University of Strasbourg where in May 1789 he presented his dissertation "Poloniam imperio Romano Germanico nunquam subjectam".
=== Diplomatic career ===
Soon after his return to Warsaw, Tepper was appointed Secretary of Legation to the first Polish diplomatic mission to Spain and was in Madrid between March–July 1791. In 1791–1792, he participated in the Polish diplomatic mission to Dresden in regard to the Constitution of 3 May 1791. During his stay in Dresden (December 1791 – March 1792) his portrait was painted by Anton Graff (present location unknown).
=== In Europe ===
After the beginning of the Russian-Polish war and the crash of his father's bank in 1793, Tepper left Warsaw for Strasbourg. In November 1793 he moved to Vienna, where he spent more than two years. He participated in Viennese musical and cultural life, met Haydn and made the acquaintance of Beethoven. There he started his career as a composer. In 1796 he moved to Hamburg where he set to music Friedrich Schiller's "Ode an die Freude".
=== In Russia ===
In autumn 1797 he came to St. Petersburg, Russia, where Tepper's bank used to have business partners and was well known to the Russian aristocracy.  There he started his career as a music teacher and composer. Many of his musical compositions which have been preserved in the libraries of St. Petersburg, Vienna, Hamburg, and Weimar, bear dedications to famous members of the St. Petersburg society, such as Princess Golitsyna, Princess Kourakine, and Countess Mniszek.
From 1800, Tepper held the post of the court Kapellmeister, after Giuseppe Sarti. He taught music to Grand Duchesses Helena, Maria, Ekaterina, and Anna, the younger sisters of the Emperor Alexander I. In 1811–1812, Tepper de Ferguson gave music lessons to Elizabeth Alexeievna, the consort of Alexander I.
He participated in earlier St. Petersburg performances of Haydn's oratorio The Creation (1801 and later). From 1802, he was a member of the newly founded St. Petersburg Philharmonic Society and regularly took part in its concerts.  In 1812, his own oratorio Te Deum was performed in St. Petersburg.
In 1802 he married Jeanne-Henriette Severin (1780–1823), a daughter of a wealthy St. Petersburg banker. Her sister was the wife of the Portuguese diplomat and merchant José Pedro Celestino Velho (1755–1802). Tepper and Jeanne-Henriette brought up Jeanne-Henriette's niece, Josephine Velho (1802–1820) who was born just after her father's death. From the 1810s, the Teppers lived in Tsarskoe Selo. Their house has survived and is still known as "Tepper's House".
From 1816, Tepper taught choir singing and music at the Imperial Lycée, where his pupils included Alexander Pushkin. Tepper composed music for the amateur theatrical performances which took place in the Lycée, and organised a choir of the Lycée students which gave informal performances in Tsarskoe Selo. In 1817, he composed music to the "Six Years, the Farewell Song of the First Students of the Imperial Lycée in Tsarskoe Selo", the words of which were written by Anton Delvig. The Farewell Song is one of the best-known Tepper compositions. In 1818, he composed choral music for the consecration of the new Evangelical church in Tsarskoe Selo. In the words of Wilhelm Küchelbecker, "Music, full of feeling and expression, is worth our honourable friend, good Tepper."
=== Last years ===
In 1819, Tepper de Ferguson, his wife and step-daughter undertook a long European travel. However, when in Paris, Josephine Velho died in a tragic accident (July 1820), and in 1823 his wife died in Dresden. Tepper de Ferguson returned to Russia for a short time, but left in May 1824 for Paris, where in July 1824 he married Marie Catherine Adelaide Canel (1790–1834). His last years were spent in Paris where he was known as Louis-Guillaume, baron Tepper de Ferguson. He died in Paris in 1838.
A nephew of Ludwig-Wilhelm, Pierre Charles Guillaume Fergusson-Tepper (the son of Peter Charles and Marie-Henriette Boué) established a successful and profitable business producing printed fabric in Bavilliers (Franche-Comté). Among his children were Marie Philippine, Tepper's god-daughter, and Louis Guillaume Edouard Fergusson-Tepper (1837–1890) who might have been named after Tepper. Louis Guillaume Edouard became a sculptor and exhibited his works in the Salons of Paris in the 1870s.
== Siblings and relatives ==
Ludwig-Wilhelm had nine brothers and sisters:
Henrika-Katarina (born 24 May 1763) married in 1780 August-Wilhelm Arndt, an employee at the Tepper bank.
Charlotte Rosa (born 4 July 1764) was in her first marriage the wife of Baron d'Axt, Minister of Prussia in Warsaw. Her second husband was Colonel Milashevich of the Russian military service. She died in 1784 in Kiev.
Elżbieta Dorota (born 8 August 1765) married in 1783 Karol Szulc (Schulz, Schultz), a young banker in Warsaw.
Peter-Charles (Peter-Karol) (1766–1817) married Marie Henriette Boué (b. 1769), daughter of Pierre Boué (1738–1802),  an influential banker in Hamburg.
Philipp-Bernard (1 August 1767 – 1829). In 1786 he was sent by his father to Edinburgh where on 5 July 1786 he was granted the citizenship of the city of Edinburgh. In the 1820s, he held a post at the Grand Duke Constantin's administration in Warsaw and died with the title Collegiate councillor (a rank in the Russian administration. He was buried in the Warsaw Evangelical-Reformed (Calvinist) Cemetery in the Powązki district, which had been established in 1792 on the property of his brother-in-law Karol Szulc.
Daniel-Frederick (born in 1772).
 Ann-Margaret (born 11 August 1775)
Anna-Isabel (born 12 August 1778) married in 1792 Count Jan Henryk Wołodkowicz (1765–1825) and divorced him in 1804. She remarried and became Anna Worcell.
Otto-Walter (1779–1797). There is a portrait of him dated 1785 at the National Museum, Warsaw.
== Legacy and selected compositions ==
In Russia, Tepper is immediately recognised as Alexander Pushkin's music teacher. But in the wider context of Russian and European cultural life of that time, his participation in the introduction of Haydn's Creation to Russian audiences seems even more important. Tepper's chamber music is well known in Russia and Europe and it is constantly performed. His "Farewell Song" is traditionally performed annually at the Museum of the Pushkin Lycée in Tsarskoe Selo on 19 October (the anniversary of the inauguration of the Lycée in 1811). Music scores of Tepper's compositions have been preserved in the music libraries of St. Petersburg, Hamburg, Vienna, Weimar, etc.

James Charles Stuart Strange (8 August 1753 – 6 October 1840) was a British officer of the East India Company, one of the first maritime fur traders, a banker, and a Member of Parliament.
== Background and education ==
James Charles Stuart Strange was born on 8 August 1753 in London, England, United Kingdom. His parents were Robert Strange and Isabella Lumisden.
His father, Robert Strange, was a former Jacobite from Orkney and had fought in the Jacobite rising of 1745, under Charles Edward Stuart, known as "Bonnie Prince Charlie" and the "Young Pretender". Robert Strange named his son James Charles Stuart Strange after Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was also James' godfather.
Robert and Isabella Strange moved to London in 1750. A few years later James Charles Stuart Strange was born. James attended the College of Navarre in Paris in 1770.
== East India Company ==
In 1772 James Strange obtained a writership with the East India Company (EIC), in Madras, India. He gained this post through Sir Lawrence Dundas, a relative of Strange's maternal grandmother. Like many members of former Jacobite families, James Strange and his brother Thomas Strange made their way to India, arriving in 1773. James advanced rapidly in the EIC and in private trade. In 1778 he became a Factor of the EIC.
In 1780 Strange returned to England, having made a fortune. He was promoted to a Junior Merchant of the EIC in 1782. On 18 February 1785 Strange married Margaret Durham. The same year he returned to India with his new bride.
From late 1785 to early 1787 he undertook a voyage to the Pacific Northwest Coast, hoping to be the first to capitalize on the nascent maritime fur trade. Afterward he returned to India and continued his career with the EIC. He was promoted to Senior Merchant in 1790. In 1795 he was appointed Collector and Paymaster for the EIC in Tanjore, India. Later that year he retired from the East India Company and returned to England.
Later he rejoined the EIC and became Magistrate Collector in Puducherry (Pondichery), in 1806, then Judge of Court of Appeal, in 1807. From 1813 to 1815 he served the EIC as Postmaster General and a Senior Member of the Board of Trade. In 1816 he retired and returned to Great Britain. On the voyage home he stopped at Saint Helena where he won a game of piquet with the exiled Napoleon.
== Voyage to the Pacific Northwest ==
In 1785 while returning to India after marrying Margaret Durham, Strange read newly published accounts of the third voyage of Captain Cook, including news of the large profits made by his crew in Guangzhou (Canton), China, selling sea otter furs they had obtained at Nootka Sound on the Pacific Northwest Coast. Captain James King, who had helped take over after the death of Cook, wrote of the possible profits to be made selling Northwest Coast furs in China.
Upon Strange's return to India and the East India Company (EIC) in later 1785, he discussed the idea of an expedition with David Scott, a prominent Mumbai (Bombay) merchant. Scott and his two partners, Tate and Adamson, obtained the support of the president and council of the East India Company in Bombay for an expedition of two ships from Mumbai (Bombay) to the Northwest Coast of America. Strange invested 10,000 pounds in the venture, which he borrowed from David Scott. Overall the cost of fitting out the expedition rose to the point where only a major success in fur trading could possibly pay back investments, let alone make a profit.
Two Bombay-built, copper-hulled snows were purchased. They were the Captain Cook of 350 tons, and the Experiment of 100 tons. The Captain Cook was commanded by Henry Laurie, and the Experiment by Henry Guise. Strange was supercargo and also in overall command of the voyage. As far as the EIC was concerned, Strange was a company servant in command of a company-sanctioned, private project that, it was hoped, would lead not only to the discovery of new channels of commerce but also forestall rival attempts.
Strange's instructions from the East India Company described two main purposes for the expedition. First, exploration for the benefit of navigation. This included instructions to return via Bering Strait, the Arctic Ocean as far as the North Pole, then Kamchatka, then China. Second, the establishment of a new channel of commerce from the Pacific Northwest Coast to China and India. Despite these instructions, the actual voyage was a commercial fur-trading venture no different from other early maritime fur trading expeditions to the Northwest Coast.
Strange's expedition left Bombay in December, 1785. Unable to acquire goods on the Malabar Coast for trade in Macau, Strange sailed directly for the Pacific Northwest. The Experiment was holed while still in the Indian Ocean, forcing a stop at Batavia (now Jakarta) for repairs, costing time and money.
After a seven-month voyage the expedition arrived on the coast of Vancouver Island on 25 June 1786, late in the trading season. On the 28th Strange entered Nootka Sound, but not the way he intended. It took nine more days to reach Yuquot, which was where Captain Cook had anchored. Strange named the harbor at Yuquot "Friendly Cove", a name which persisted for a long time. He spent about a month trading for furs around Nootka Sound with the native Nuu-chah-nulth. Strange conducted the trading negotiations himself and, like other traders, found the Nuu-chah-nulth very shrewd traders.
Beyond trading negotiations, Strange did not interact with the natives very much. Alexander Walker, an ensign of the Bombay Army and later Governor of Saint Helena, who had shipped aboard the Experiment, spent a great deal of time with the Nuu-chah-nulth. He had studied the language based on Cook's vocabularies, and was able to talk with the Nuu-chah-nulth. He was astonished to learn that the British fur trader James Hanna had been at Nootka Sound a year before. Up until then Strange and his crew thought themselves the first fur traders on the Northwest Coast. Walker wrote favorably of chiefs Maquinna and Callicum, who later came to figure prominently in the Nootka Crisis. Both Walker and Strange were confused about the rank of Maquinna and Callicum and generally about the Nuu-chah-nulth's system of social hierarchy. Maquinna was the highest ranked chief of the highest ranked house, while Callicum was the leading chief of the second ranking house. The visitors did not understand these things. Walker and Strange both showed preference to Callicum, and Strange made the mistake of giving gifts to Callicum before Maquinna. These things offended Maquinna and caused tension and uneasiness, which Walker failed to understand. Still, Walker's descriptions of the Nuu-chah-nulth are valuable as the earliest detailed documentation, other than Captain Cook's 1778 journal, since no first-hand account of Hanna's 1785 stay at Nootka Sound survives.
Strange had been instructed to establish a trading relationship with the natives. To this end he left John Mackay, assistant surgeon of the Experiment, at Nootka Sound. Strange hoped to make a second expedition, which would benefit from Mackay's time at Nootka Sound, but a second expedition never happened. Mackay remained with Maquinna's Nuu-chah-nulth for about a year. At first Mackay was quite satisfied, but one day he accidentally broke a taboo that earned him the wrath of Maquinna, after which Mackay was poorly treated and spent a miserable winter. In June 1787 Charles William Barkley arrived at Friendly Cove in the Imperial Eagle. Mackay helped Barkley gain 700 sea otter pelts from the Nuu-chah-nulth. In August another maritime fur trader, George Dixon, arrived in the King George. Mackay, eager to leave, shipped out with Dixon.
Leaving Mackay behind, Strange left Nootka Sound in late July, 1786, sailing north. He stopped near the northern end of Vancouver Island, which he named Cape Scott, after David Scott, his patron in Mumbai (Bombay). He found and named the Scott Islands. He found San Josef Bay and named it Scott's Bay, also after his patron, but in that case his name did not survive to the present day. Strange explored the waters north of Vancouver Island, which he named Queen Charlotte Sound. Contact was made with a group of Kwakwaka'wakw off the north coast of Vancouver Continuing east and south around Vancouver Island Strange noted the more constricted waters of Queen Charlotte Strait. Strange's discovery of Queen Charlotte Strait revived speculation about Bartolome de Fonte's alleged Northwest Passage. Strange himself thought he had found the entrance to the fabled strait, but fur trading took priority and he did not investigate. Furs were not plentiful in this area, so Strange sailed north, making for Prince William Sound in Alaska, as Cook had done.
On the way north land was sighted, probably Haida Gwaii, but Strange kept far to sea and passed by. On 29 August 1786, Cape Hinchinbrook, the entrance to Prince William Sound, was sighted. The two ships entered and sailed to Snug Corner Cove, where Cook had anchored. They stayed for about two weeks, until 16 September. Strange tried to acquire furs but it was late in the season and there was little to be had. Additionally, the natives were far less enthusiastic about trade than the Nuu-chah-nulth.
While at Prince William Sound Strange was joined by William Tipping of the Sea Otter. After their encounter, Tipping's Sea Otter was never seen again. It might have been attacked and destroyed, or it might have been lost at sea.
In September 1786, Strange left Prince William Sound and sailed to Canton, China. He sold his furs for about £5,600, which was not nearly enough to cover the expenses of the expedition, nor even his own personal investment. Although his venture was a financial disaster, Strange was one of the first trader-explorers working on Pacific Northwest Coast, along with James Hanna, Charles William Barkley, and George Dixon.
== Political career ==
In 1796 James Strange, a Whig, became a Member of Parliament (MP) as a guest of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, a silent supporter of William Pitt's administration. Strange's constituency was East Grinstead.
In 1802 Strange was elected as MP of Okehampton, having been recommended to the patron Henry Holland by James Strange's father-in-law Henry Dundas. Strange survived a challenge to his election by two wealthy London merchants. Strange was an inconspicuous MP, speaking only once, arguing against severity toward James Trotter, an election offender.
== Banking ==
After retiring from the East India Company in 1795 Strange became a partner in the bank of Strange, Dashwood & Company, of New Bond Street, London. In 1803 Strange's bank failed, which left him impoverished and caused him to return to India, where his brother Sir Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange helped James acquire employment with the East India Company.
== Personal life ==
James Strange's first marriage, in 1785, was to Margaret Durham, the daughter of James Durham of Largo, Fife, Scotland. Margaret's brother was Philip Charles Durham, later Admiral Sir Philip Charles Calderwood Henderson Durham of the Royal Navy. They had one daughter, Isabella Katherine Strange (1785-1847). Margaret died in 1791.
In 1798 Strange married Anne Dundas, the daughter of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, and widow of Henry Drummond, an English banker and politician. They had three daughters: Mary Anne Strange (c. 1806–1889), Louisa Strange (1810-1895), and Isabella Strange (1816-1879).
In 1816, after his second time in India working for the EIC, Strange retired to Scotland.
After a five-month illness, James Strange died on 7October 1840 at Airth Castle, Airth, Lanarkshire, Scotland.
== Legacy ==
Several places in British Columbia were named for James Strange, including Strange Island, in Nootka Sound, and Strange Rock, near Cape Scott, Guise Bay, and Lowrie Bay. Other places are named for Strange's captains, Guise and Lowrie, and his ships, Captain Cook and Experiment. For example, near Cape Scott at the north end of Vancouver Island, Experiment Bight, and Guise Bay. And in Fitz Hugh Sound, Guise Point, and Experiment Point.

Hilmer J. "Tiny" Timbrell (January 15, 1917 – May 7, 1992) was a Canadian-born session guitarist.
Timbrell was born in Canada but moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue his career in music. For a time, he sold guitars at Fife & Nichols, a Hollywood musical instrument store located at the corner of Sunset & Vine inside Wallach's Music City.
A "first call" guitarist at Warner Brothers Studios, in the late 1940s Timbrell appeared in several motion pictures playing as part of a band. His reputation was such that he was hired to play guitar on recording sessions for singing stars such as Doris Day, Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra, Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby, Harry James, and pop and country music artists such as Ricky Nelson and Marty Robbins.
Perhaps most significantly in his career, Timbrell played rhythm guitar for Elvis Presley, first at Radio Recorders studios in Los Angeles for the making of the soundtrack for the film, Loving You and later on numerous other soundtracks for Presley films.
In 1943, Timbrell married Margaret Ellen Scott. They had two children: Gail and Jay. Gail married and had three children: Roger, Nancy, and Steven. Both Roger and Steven followed their grandfather into the entertainment industry. Roger is a studio production accountant responsible for developing Showbiz Crew and SAG-AFTRA software. Steven works as an IATSE Local 1 stagehand in New York City. 
In his later years, Timbrell worked as Los Angeles district sales representative for Chicago Musical Instrument Co., later named Norlin Music Corp., which at the time owned many instrument brands, including Gibson and Epiphone guitars.
Tiny Timbrell died in 1992 at the age of 75.

The Chicken of Tomorrow Contest was an animal husbandry contest held between 1946 and 1948 and sponsored by the American grocery store chain A&P, in partnership with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), to encourage the development of broiler chickens breeds with more meat. Most broiler chickens around the world descend from the contest.
== History ==
In 1945, A&P was convicted by the U.S. Justice Department for criminal restraint of trade. To improve its image during and after the trial, A&P decided to start the contest in addition to other public service work
and press releases.
In 1946, the competition began with state contests. Farmers and breeders brought hatching eggs to purpose-built facilities where the chicks were hatched and then raised in controlled conditions. The chicks' rate of growth and health was monitored for 12 weeks. They were then slaughtered, weighed, and judged on the basis of edible meat produced.
In 1947, regional contests were held. From the regional contests, 40 finalists were selected to compete in the national competition for the title of "Chicken of Tomorrow". The final competition was held in 1948 at the University of Delaware Agricultural Experiment Station.
The winners of the contest in the purebred category were the White Rocks belonging to Henry Saglio of Arbor Acres farm. Saglio was the son of an Italian immigrant who grew fruits and vegetables on a small family farm in Glastonbury, Connecticut. Saglio began raising chickens in a small coop he made from an old piano. The Red Cornish crosses from the Vantress Hatchery won the overall contest. After his win, Saglio built his family farm into one of the leading poultry development companies. He created the Arbor Acre breed, a cross of his White Rocks and the Vantress Red Cornish. Today, the genetics from the line are found poultry farms globally.
In June 1948, the contest had a three mile long parade through Georgetown, Delaware which included a Chicken of Tomorrow Queen who rode in a carriage in the parade.
The contest is described in the 1948 documentary short film The Chicken of Tomorrow.

Powassan encephalitis, caused by the Powassan virus (POWV), a flavivirus also known as the deer tick virus, is a form of arbovirus infection that results from tick bites. It can occur as a co-infection with Lyme disease, as both are transmitted to humans by the same species of tick. Over the last decade, there has been a surge in the number of cases and an expansion of its geographic range. In the United States, cases have been documented primarily in the northeast. The disease was first isolated from the brain of a boy who died of encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, in 1958. This disease is classified as a zoonosis, originating in animals, often found in rodents and ticks, with subsequent transmission to humans. The virus shares antigenic similarities with the Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis viruses.
== Presentation ==
Symptoms manifest within 7–10 days and include fever, headache, partial paralysis, confusion, nausea and even coma.
== Diagnosis ==
== Treatment ==
There is currently no established treatment.
== Prognosis ==
Half of all cases results in permanent neurological damage and 10-15% result in death.

The Palouse  are a Sahaptin tribe recognized in the Treaty of 1855 with the United States along with the Yakama. It was negotiated at the 1855 Walla Walla Council. A variant spelling is Palus. Today they are enrolled in the federally recognized Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation and some are also represented by the Colville Confederated Tribes, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and Nez Perce Tribe.
== Ethnography ==
The people are one of the Sahaptin-speaking groups of Native Americans living on the Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, and North Central Idaho: these included the Nez Percé, Cayuse, Walla Walla, Umatilla and the Yakama.
The Palouse (Palus) territory extends from the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers in the east to the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers in the west. It encompassed the Palouse River Valley up to Rock Lake in the north and stayed north of the Touchet River Valley in the south. To the north, their territory bordered the Sinkiuse-Columbia, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene; to the east, their territory bordered the Nez Perce; to the south, the Cayuse and Walla Walla; and to the west, they bordered the eastern boundary of the Yakama and Wanapum territories. The Palouse (Palus) lived in three main regional bands, composed of several village-based groups:
Upper Palouse (Palus) Band: often formed bilingual village communities with the Almotipu Band and Alpowna (Alpowai) Band of the Nez Perce people, the Lewis and Clark Expedition referred to them as Chopunnish (Nez Percé), their villages along the Clearwater River (from west to east) Pinăwăwi/Pinawa’wi (Penawawa) ("coming out of bushy area to fish"), Witkispe (Witkispu), Wawawi/Wawáwi (Wawawai) ("place of mosquitoes"), Alamotin/Alamo’tin (Almota) ("soaring flame") and Alpo’wa (Alpowa) ("total area of fishing") were identified by Americans and in treaties as "Nez Percé villages" and therefore their lands were included into the Nez Perce Indian Reservation; today part of the "Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation" and "Nez Perce Tribe". The "Pinăwăwi/Pinawa’wi (Penawawa) Palouse" were identified as Pinewewixpu (Pinăwăwipu) Nez Perce Band, the "Witkispe (Witkispu) Palouse" as Witkispu Nez Perce Band, the "Wawawi/Wawáwi (Wawawai) Palouse" as Wawawipu Nez Perce Band, the "Alamotin/Alamo’tin (Almota) Palouse" as Almotipu Nez Perce Band, and the "Alpo’wa (Alpowa) Palouse" as Alpowna (Alpowai) Nez Perce Band.
Middle Palouse (Palus) Band: lived along the Palouse River, Lower Clearwater River and along the Tucannon River, their main village Pa-luš-sa/Palus at the junction of Palouse and Snake River about 4 mi (6 km) downstream from the Palouse Falls (Aputaput - "Falling Water") gave its name to the entire Palouse tribe, often allies of the "Pikunan (Pikunin) Band" of the Nez Percé, the Lewis and Clark Expedition referred to them as the "Pelloatpallah (Nez Percé)", the majority are now part of the "Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation", a minority of the "Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation".
Lower Palouse (Palus) Band: lived along the Lower Snake River to its confluence with the Columbia River near the present-day Tri-Cities metropolitan area; the Lewis and Clark Expedition referred to them as "Sokulks" and "Chymnapums"; later historians also identified them as "Nez Percé," now part of the "Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation".
The ancestral people were nomadic, following food sources through the seasons. The Palus people gathered with other native peoples for activities such as food-gathering, hunting, fishing, feasting, trading, and celebrations that included dancing, sports and gambling. They lived near other groups including the Nez Perce, Wanapum, Walla Walla, Umatilla and Yakama peoples.
The present tribal designation probably derives from the proper designation of the most populous of the three regional bands of the Palouse/Palus people - the ″Middle Palouse/Palus Band″ as Palúšpam - "people of Pa-luš-sa/Palus [one of their most important settlements]", the neighboring Nez Percé also called them Pa-loots-poo/Pelú`cpu/Peluutspu and the Yakama Palúuspam/Pelúuspem both meaning "people of Pa-luš-sa/Palus", their proper autonym was Naxiyamtama or Naha’ámpoo/Naha'u'umpu'u - “the river people”.
The people were expert horsemen. The term Appaloosa is probably a derivation of the term "A Palouse horse." They bred the horses for their distinct markings. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the United States Army captured and slaughtered hundreds of tribal horses to cripple the tribe during the Indian Wars.
== History ==
In October 1805, Lewis and Clark met with the tribe, although most were away from the area for fall food-gathering and hunting. Lewis and Clark presented one of the expedition's silver peace medals to paramount Chief Kepowhan. The Diaries of the Corps of Discovery describe the people as a separate and distinct group from the Nez Percé.
After Kepowhan, during the decades 1830', 1840', 1850, Wattaiwattaihowlis (Kepowhan's son and probably principal chief), Kahlotus (known also as Quelaptip and Talatuche, chief of the Upper Palouse), Soei (chief of the Middle Palouse), Nehtalekin (called also Hahtalekin the Elder), Tilcoax (chief of the Lower Palouse), Hinmahtutekekaikt alias "James" (one among the first to be Christianized, friend to Henry H. Spalding and Marcus Whitman, often associated to the Nimiipu band of Hollolsotetote), were the leaders until the Isaac I. Stevens Treaty in 1855, when the Palouse refused to take part but sent, as observers, Kahlotus (already a good friend to Marcus Whitman), Tilcoax (a war chief) and Slyotze; "Old" Hathalekin and Tilcoax led the Palouse warriors against the U.S. troops during the Cayuse's uprising in 1847–1848, defeating col. Cornelius Gilliam and his "Oregon Volunteers" on the Tucannon Creek (March 14–15, 1848). In 1858 Tilcoax led again the Palouse warriors in the "Skitswish (Coeur d'Alene) War": in May 1858 the Palouses succeeded in taking possession of a herd of Army's horses, but, on September 8, 1858, their own herd of 800 horses was slaughtered by col. George Wright's soldiers, and they surrendered.
Husishusis Kute, chief of the Wawawai Palouse, and "Young" Hathalekin (also known as Taktsoukt Jlppilp), war-chief, led a small Palouse band as allies of the last free Nimiipu of Heinmot Tooyalaket alias "Chief Joseph"; "Young" Hathalekin died fighting on August 9, 1877, at Big Hole; Husishusis Kute surrendered with Heinmot Tooyalaket on October 5, 1877.
== Notable Palouse ==
Palouse Chiefs
Tilcoax ("Wolf Necklace") led the Palouse warriors during the Skitswish (Coeur d'Alene) war in 1858, fighting against Maj. Steptoe and Col. Wright troops.
Husishusis Kute (Husis Husis Kute, Hush-hush-cute - “Bald Head”, “Naked Head”), was leader and tooat — Medicine man or Shaman, or Prophet — of the Wawawai Band. Its territory was along the Snake River below Lewiston, 50 miles up the Snake River from where the Palouse enters it.
Hahtalekin (also known as Taktsoukt Jlppilp - “Echo” or “Red Echo”), chief of the Palus Band (or Palus proper), who lived at the confluence of the Snake and Palouse rivers. His band were all of the buffalo-hunter-class. During the flight with the Nez Perce, his following was made up of 16 men.

John Meredith Smith  (July 24, 1933 – May 9, 2000), known professionally as John Meredith, was a Canadian abstract expressionist painter.
His trademark as a painter was rich, exciting colour which he combined with loosely figurative images of vertical stripes and forms or idiosyncratic calligraphy. He often used a small coloured ink drawing divided into squares as a template from which to develop his large canvases. In 1966, he began using details from still-wet drawings he had smudged – a way of working he regarded as his invention.
== Biography ==
Meredith was born in Fergus, Ontario, but while still a young child, his family moved to Brampton, Ontario. Like his older brother (artist William Ronald), he attended the Ontario College of Art (1950-1953), studying with Jock Macdonald, and became interested in abstract art. After he graduated, he worked for the local newspaper, (the Brampton Conservator), as a cartoonist. In 1958, while still making his home in Brampton, he held the first solo show of his work at Toronto's Gallery of Contemporary Art. His work at this time includes sombre canvases of the late 1950s and 1960 with dark colours, sometimes interspersed with red and purple, as well as loosely figurative images of vertical stripes and forms.
Meredith held his second solo show in 1961 at Toronto's Isaacs Gallery. The exhibition was favorably reviewed in the Toronto Star and he joined the Isaacs Gallery in 1962. In 1963, he moved to Toronto and continued to paint and hold solo shows. In 1963, he showed at the Isaacs Gallery and in 1965, at the Blue Barn Gallery and then at the Isaacs Gallery again (1967, 1969). In these years, he developed brightly coloured dynamic canvases. Seeker, a triptych, in the collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, is possibly his most major work. He developed from a study of coloured inks on paper which is also in the gallery collection. Meredith painted it with his parents in mind, thinking of them as spiritual beings, and it took him four months to paint.
There were more changes to come. Over a period of years, Meredith recalled the calligraphy of Oriental art, his symbolic imagery changed into abstract imagery, and he used colour to explore space, enriching his palette to include pinks, purples and greens, then staining his canvas in the manner of other artists of the period.
In these years too, he was given major recognition for his work and included in many group shows, both in Canada and abroad. Moreover, in 1986, in his home town of Brampton, the Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives held a 30-year survey of his work.
By the end of the 1990s, the work of Meredith, often painted with Expressionist brio, offered the public a more dramatic vision of the artist, but in reinstating colour and using the palette knife in his work, Meredith reflected more overtly than ever before the rich allocations of pigment to canvas so characteristic of Ronald and especially apparent in Ronald’s late works with their thick layers of dripped and splashed paint. But Ronald was ill (he died in 1998) and Meredith may have felt that a tribute was in order.
Meredith died of pneumonia on September 9, 2000, in Toronto.

Coal Mines Historic Site was a convict probation station and the site of Tasmania's (then Van Diemen's Land's) first operational coal mine, serving for a period of 15 years (1833–1848) "as a place of punishment for the 'worst class' of convicts from Port Arthur".
It is now the site of a collection of ruins and landscape modifications located amongst bushland facing onto the Tasman Peninsula's Little Norfolk Bay, being ruins and landscape modifications of such cultural significance to Australia and to the World that the site has been formally inscribed onto both the Australian National Heritage List and UNESCO's World Heritage list as amongst:
... the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts.

Another Way to Find You is a live studio album by American singer/songwriter Chris Smither, released in 1991. It was recorded in the studio in front of a live audience.
== Reception ==
Writing for Allmusic, critic Cub Koda wrote of the album "His guitar work is clean and well played, and his vocals attain a sense of engagement throughout. While his interpretations of tunes by Chuck Berry, Randy Newman, Elizabeth Cotton, Blind Willie McTell, Jimmy Reed and others are fine, the true highlights come with the originals..." Music critic Robert Christgau wrote of the album "Smither is an easy taste to acquire: he strums as if to the second line born, sings in a lazy, roughly luxuriant baritone, writes when he's got something to say, and understands o.p.'s from the inside out."

Vindhya Pradesh was a former state of India. It occupied an area of 61,131.5 km2 (23,603 sq. miles). It was created in 1948 as Union of Baghelkhand and Bundelkhand States, shortly after Indian independence, from the territories of the princely states in the eastern portion of the former Central India Agency. It was named as Vindhya Pradesh on 25 January 1950 after the Vindhya Range, which runs through the centre of the province. The capital of the state was the former princely state of Rewa. It lay between Uttar Pradesh to the north and Madhya Pradesh to the south, and the enclave of Datia, which lay a short distance to the west, was surrounded by the state of Madhya Bharat.
Vindhya Pradesh was merged into Madhya Pradesh in 1956, following the States Reorganisation Act.

Vindhya Pradesh state was formed on 12 March 1948 and the newly formed state was inaugurated on 4 April 1948. Following its formation 36 princely states were merged to form Vindhya Pradesh state: 
On 25 January 1950, 11 erstwhile princely states, namely, Bihat, Banka Paharee, Baoni, Beri, Bijna, Charkhari, Jigni, Samthar, Sarila, Tori-Fatehpur and parts of Kirur Kubje were transferred to Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Bharat. Vindhya Pradesh, together with the states of Madhya Bharat and Bhopal State, was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956.
== Divisions ==
After formation, the state was divided into two divisions, which were further divided into 8 districts.
Bundelkhand Division with its headquarters at Nowgaon comprised the following 4 districts:
Panna district
Chhatarpur district
Tikamgarh district
Datia district
Baghelkhand Division with its headquarters at Singrauli and then Rewa comprised the following 4 districts: 
Rewa district
Satna district
Sidhi district
Shahdol district
Singrauli district
== Politics ==
The nominal heads of the state were the Rajpramukh from 1948–49, the Chief Commissioner from March 1949–1952 and the Lieutenant Governor from March 1952–October 1956. The state had a Vidhan Sabha comprising 60 members elected from 48 constituencies (36 single-member and 12 double-member). There were 4 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state (2 single-member and 2 double-member).
Following the formation of the state, Martand Singh, the last ruler of the princely state of Rewa became the Rajpramukh and Yadvendra Singh, the last ruler of the princely state of Panna became the Uparajpramukh. Initially Awadhesh Pratap Singh became the Chief Minister of the Vindhya Pradesh.
After he resigned on 14 April 1949, N.B. Bonerji, took over on 15 April 1949 as Chief Commissioner. He was succeeded by S. N. Mehta.
In the first general election in 1951, the Indian National Congress won 40 seats and the Socialist Party won 11 seats. S.N.Shukla of Indian National Congress became the Chief Minister of the state on 13 March 1952, Shivanand became the Speaker and Ram Kishore Shukla of Socialist Party the leader of the opposition of the house. The house dissolved on 31 October 1956.
Nowadays the voices of separation of Vindhya Pradesh from Madhya Pradesh, are stoked by Maihar MLA Narayan Tripathi and social worker, Kuldeep Agnihotri, who is associated with the Agni Shakti Education Foundation, in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.

HIV/AIDS in Argentina was considered a concentrated epidemic by 2012. 
== Prevalence ==
In 2019, UNAIDS estimates placed the number of people living with HIV at about 140,000.
In 2010, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the general population was less than 1%. In some groups the percentage was 6%, while in others there is a major incidence. Considering the whole country, 70% of cases are concentrated in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.
== History ==
In 1982 the first patient with AIDS was reported in Argentina. Since 1982, the Ministry of Health has kept records of cases. Until mid-2000, more than 17,000 patients (12,732 men, 3,074 women and 1,214 children under 15 years) were reported.
In 1987, it was reported the first case of a woman infected with HIV.
In 2012, 5,500 new HIV cases were being reported in Argentina every year. 90% of them acquired the virus by having sex without a condom.
In 2012, there were about 110,000 people infected with HIV in Argentina, of whom only 50% knew their status. Of these, 47,000 were under treatment, 69% in the public service and the rest covered by private health insurance plans.

The tank destroyer battalion was a type of military unit used by the United States Army during World War II. The unit was organized in one of two different forms—a towed battalion equipped with anti-tank guns, or a mechanized battalion equipped with armored self-propelled guns. The tank destroyer units were formed in response to the German use of massed formations of armored vehicles units early in WWII. The tank destroyer concept envisioned the battalions acting as independent units that would respond at high speed to large enemy tank attacks. In this role, they would be attached in groups or brigades to corps or armies. In practice, they were usually individually attached to infantry divisions. Over one hundred battalions were formed, of which more than half saw combat service. The force was disbanded shortly after the end of the war when the concept had been shown to be militarily unsound.
== Doctrine development ==
In April 1941, a conference focused on the future of antitank operations. The immediate effect was to create an anti-tank battalion in infantry divisions, but this organic anti-tank capacity was not deemed sufficient. The conference gave broad support to the idea of creating mobile anti-tank defensive units (commanded by corps or army formations) which could be deployed to meet an armored attack. The effort stalled on the issue of which branch of the Army should control it—the infantry (as a defensive role), the cavalry (as a mobile response force), or the artillery (as heavy guns). The Armor Branch did not press for control of the anti-tank units, feeling that it would be at odds with their general principles of maintaining the offensive. In May, General George C. Marshall "cut through the knot" by declaring the issue as sufficiently important to be dealt with as a combined-arms organization, forming an Anti-Tank Planning Board headed by Lt. Col. Andrew D. Bruce, and appointing Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair to take immediate action on organizing anti-tank forces.
Three anti-tank "groups" were quickly organized, with each of three anti-tank battalions drawn from infantry divisions and various support units, and tasked with "speedy and aggressive action to search out and attack opposing tanks before they had assumed formation". In August, a plan was laid out for a program of 220 anti-tank battalions.
The first nine units were deployed during the Louisiana Maneuvers of 1941, equipped with towed 37 mm M3 anti-tank guns (the largest gun that could be towed by a jeep) and surplus 75 mm M1897 guns mounted on half-tracks (the M3 gun motor carriage), and again in the Carolinas maneuvers that November. Their employment was judged a success—though not without some disgruntled voices in the Armored Branch arguing that the umpires had rigged the results — and on 27 November, Marshall ordered the establishment of a tank destroyer Tactical and Firing Center at Fort Hood, Texas, under Bruce, and the activation of 53 new anti-tank battalions under the command of General Headquarters. The term "tank destroyer" was used from this point on, as it was seen as a more psychologically powerful term. On 3 December, all existing anti-tank battalions were reassigned to General Headquarters and converted to tank destroyer battalions.
The new tank destroyer doctrine was formally stated in Field Manual 18–5, Tactical Employment, Tank Destroyer Unit, in June 1942. It laid down a focused doctrine— "There is but one objective of tank destroyer units… the destruction of hostile tanks" —and repeatedly emphasized an offensive, vigorous spirit. Tank destroyer units were expected to be employed as complete battalions, held in reserve and committed at critical points, rather than parceled out as small defensive strongpoints. The emphasis was heavy on mobility, and the ability to outmaneuver the attacking armor; this would feed into vehicle design, and cause the speed of a vehicle to be prioritized over survivability.
One side-effect of the new status of the tank destroyer force was that, as a fully-fledged independent branch, it was required by War Department policy to establish units manned by African Americans – the  United States Army remained racially segregated until the Korean War, but the War Department placed pressure on the Army to ensure that a fair proportion of combat units were black. Two of the initially converted battalions were black, with another four created in 1942 and four (of a planned six) in 1943. Several would eventually see combat, and the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion would become the first black unit to receive a Distinguished Unit Citation.{{efn|The two original units were the 795th and the 846th (later deactivated); the honored unit was 3rd Platoon, Company C, 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion
=== Tactics ===
US tank destroyer doctrine was essentially a defensive and reactive measure. Their role was to slow down, or even stop, a Blitzkrieg style armored thrust and prevent it from penetrating too deeply or from encircling friendly forces in a pincer movement. The idea was that, once an enemy armored thrust was expected to break through, the tank destroyer battalion (as a single unit and operating behind the front lines), would position itself to intercept the enemy while a more complete defense is organized at corps or higher level. This was to be the case for both towed and mobile tank destroyer battalions. As the enemy armored thrust approached, organic reconnaissance units would communicate to battalion commanders the best locations for tank destroyer units to place themselves in, while organic pioneer units would create blockades or help the tank destroyers dig into their positions. As the enemy armored thrust came within range, the hidden tank destroyer units would fire upon enemy tanks and then retreat to another position once they began to draw fire.
In the offense, mobile tank destroyers were not given the duty to hunt down enemy tanks, as this would be the role of their own tanks. Instead, they were to be positioned close to the advance to stop any counter-attacking armored force. Towed tank destroyer units had no offensive role in an armored thrust, and were given the task of supporting infantry units or being used as indirect fire units to augment artillery. Mobile tank destroyers were also allowed to support infantry operations, or even function in an indirect fire role, so long as their main mission was not compromised.
In terms of vehicle design, mobile tank destroyers were to be heavily armed, but with speed given priority over armor protection. Unlike tanks, mobile tank destroyers were not designed to survive hits from enemy AP rounds, but to mainly resist small arms fire. Crews were also trained to hide their vehicle from enemy fire.
== Organization ==
Three initial organizations were laid down in December 1941; two were light organisations equipped solely with 37mm guns, and were abandoned as soon as possible to standardise on the third type, modeled after the 893rd Tank Destroyer Battalion, and officially declared the standard organization with the publication of FM 18–5 in June 1942. This was designated the "tank destroyer battalion, heavy, self-propelled", and consisted of:
A headquarters company
A reconnaissance company (including a pioneer platoon),
Three tank destroyer companies of twelve vehicles each
The three tank destroyer companies each had one platoon of four 37mm self-propelled guns and two platoons of 75mm self-propelled guns. Each platoon had two sections of two guns each, an anti-aircraft section of two self-propelled 37mm guns, and a "security section" of twelve infantrymen. This gave a total of twenty-four 75mm guns, twelve 37mm guns, eighteen anti-aircraft guns, and 108 security troops. The vehicles used were the M3 GMC, with a 75mm gun, and the M6 GMC, a 3/4 ton 4x4 Dodge truck with a 37 mm gun mounted in the rear compartment facing to the rear.
The battalions deployed to North Africa used this organization, with both heavy and light anti-tank guns, but as reports from Europe indicated that light anti-tank guns were no longer playing a significant role in combat, the light platoons were converted to a third "heavy" 75mm gun platoon under a new organization issued in November 1942. As M10 tank destroyers came into use, with a 3-inch gun, these replaced the 75mm gun-equipped M3 GMCs.
By 1943, the role of tank destroyer battalions was becoming better understood, and the early ideas of mass employment of tank destroyer units had become obsolete. As a result, the number of battalions planned was steadily reduced, and the manpower and equipment assigned to them was reduced. A new table of organization produced in January 1943 reduced the overall manpower by 25%, by eliminating the anti-aircraft units (which had proven unnecessary), reducing the number of supporting units, and combining the tank destroyer platoon's headquarters with its security section. There was no reduction in actual combat strength.
In early 1943, stemming from problems found in North Africa, the Army began to consider a more defensive role for tank destroyer units. After trials in January, fifteen battalions were ordered to convert to towed guns on 31 March, and shortly thereafter it was decided that half of all tank destroyer units would convert to a towed organization. The broad outline of the battalion remained – three companies of three platoons of four guns – but the reconnaissance company was downgraded to two platoons in the headquarters company. However, the need for larger gun crews and more security troops meant that the manpower of the unit increased again. These units were equipped with 3-inch M5 guns towed by trucks or M3 Halftracks. However, combat experience in Normandy and in Italy – coupled with the fact that purpose-built M18 Hellcat and M36 tank destroyers were becoming available – showed that the towed units were underperforming compared with self-propelled ones. After the Ardennes campaign, where 85% of all tank destroyer losses were towed guns, it was decided to convert all towed units back to self-propelled guns.
=== Reconnaissance and pioneer units ===
The Reconnaissance company of the tank destroyer battalion was made up of three reconnaissance platoons and one pioneer platoon, along with supporting units.
The reconnaissance platoons had two main missions for the battalion's tank destroyer units: "Route reconnaissance, particularly of those routes over which the gun companies will move to reach combat areas", and "Area reconnaissance, particularly to locate general areas suitable for use as combat areas by the gun companies". Other missions included zone reconnaissance, battle reconnaissance, security missions and counter-reconnaissance. Each platoon had two M8 Greyhound armored cars and five 1/4 ton trucks (jeeps). In the context of Tank Destroyer doctrine - that the battalion be placed in the path of an enemy armored thrust - the reconnaissance platoons served to seek and locate areas for tank destroyer units to set up.
The pioneer platoon had two general missions: to prevent the movement of the battalion from being delayed by natural or artificial obstacles, and to impede or canalize the movement of the enemy by the creation of obstacles. The pioneer platoon consisted of a platoon headquarters and two sections, each section included ten men and two 1+1⁄2-ton trucks equipped with pioneer tools and equipment; the platoon headquarters consisted of six men, an M20 armored utility car (a variant of the Greyhound), and an air compressor (MT2) complete with all its various air powered tools.
Since neither the pioneer nor reconnaissance units were able to function as originally intended (see below), they were often attached to other units (such as engineering battalions or cavalry reconnaissance squadrons) that operated under the division or corps that the tank destroyer battalion had been assigned to.
== Combat experience ==
=== North Africa ===
During the Tunisian Campaign of 1942–1943, the US forces would employ seven tank destroyer battalions. However, contrary to doctrine they were invariably broken up down to the platoon level to support infantry units. On the one occasion where a tank destroyer battalion was employed as an organized unit—the 601st, at the Battle of El Guettar—it defended against an attack by the 10th Panzer Division, destroying 30 of its 57 tanks. This engagement had the distinction of being the only time a battalion would fight in the way envisaged by the original "tank destroyer" concept, as an organized independent unit opposing an armored force in open terrain. The 601st lost 24 of its 36 M3 GMC tank destroyers. Seven M10 tank destroyers from the 899th tank destroyer battalion were also lost in the battle.
Critical analysis of the new force was mixed; while the 601st had successfully repulsed the attack, it had lost two-thirds of its strength in the process, contributing to Major General George Patton's declaration that the concept was "unsuccessful in the conditions of the theater". McNair responded by further clarifying the role of the tank destroyer—it was to be a highly mobile force, which sought to find and occupy favorable positions to engage an oncoming enemy attack. A tank destroyer "need only to maneuver for a favorable position, conceal itself thoroughly and ambush the tank"—it was not intended to be used in a frontal offensive, or in assault in combat like a tank.
Training problems were also exposed. Mobile Tank Destroyer units had not been trained to work together as a battalion - despite the doctrine being so clearly to the fore, actual training of the units was done at a small unit level. Also at issue was the performance of the organic reconnaissance units, who had never experienced such extended distances in training as they were forced to operate in North Africa. With an inability to work together as a battalion, along with the poor performance of the organic reconnaissance units, many vehicles were lost in the Battle of El Guettar.
Major changes to the overall doctrine emerged from the North African campaign.
Flaws had emerged in the M3 GMC and M10 tank destroyers—they were not fast enough, and had an overly high silhouette which made them vulnerable to direct enemy fire. Major General Omar Bradley, then commanding the U.S. II Corps in North Africa, suggested that towed anti-tank guns could be reintroduced to infantry units—while it was feared this would lead to a lack of offensive spirit, it was undeniable that a small towed gun could be dug in very quickly and efficiently, giving a very low-profile target, though a large gun sometimes took a day to fully prepare. Bradley's proposal was not, however, intended to create towed TD battalions. His intent was to put the anti-tank assets in the hands of infantry units. The fact that the British Army had had success with dug-in antitank guns supported his proposal, and an experimental battalion was established in the summer with 3-inch guns. This quickly gained popularity—heavily supported by McNair—and in November 1943 it was ordered that half of all tank destroyer battalions were to be equipped with towed guns; this was a major distortion of Bradley's suggestion.
The expected employment of the battalions shifted. While the formal doctrine still called for the employment of complete battalions, the Tank Destroyer Center began to emphasize a new focus on combined arms training and small-unit actions. New field manuals were prepared to discuss the independent operation of tank-destroyer platoons, and crews began to have specialized training in their secondary roles, such as indirect gunnery or anti-fortification work.
Changes in training were made to ensure that tank destroyer units acted according to operating procedure. This was necessary because too many tank destroyer units in North Africa were "behaving like tanks" and attacking German tanks "head-on", despite their lack of armor. Further training changes involved the role of the organic reconnaissance companies, which were not adequately performing their assigned tasks: route and area reconnaissance with the specific aim of finding locations for tank destroyers to ambush approaching enemy tanks.
=== Sicily and Italy ===
 There were not enough anti-tank guns to cover the frontage and still have depth. That left gaps in the AT defenses that were filled by bringing tanks and tank destroyers way forward. These were such big targets, since they could not be dug- in, that many of them were knocked out by German 88mm guns and Mark VI tanks. As a result we lost some ground to tank-led attacks. Then we put all our anti-tank guns right in the front line wherever they could be dug-in to cover the front. We placed the tanks and tank destroyers well back but ready to move up to reinforce the anti-tank guns. After we took this action, we stopped all the tank-led attacks cold.
—Executive Officer, 15th Infantry Regiment
The second theater of operations for tank destroyer units was the Italian campaign, beginning with the landings in Sicily in July 1943, and continuing into mainland Italy that September. While German armor was present in the theater, it was rarely committed to battle in large groups; this was partly a result of the broken, heavily cultivated, terrain, but also due to a growing conservatism and defensive ethos on the German side. As a result, the tank destroyers found themselves used for a variety of other tasks, most commonly local artillery support.
A report in late 1944, reviewing the use of tank destroyer units in combat, found that in practice they were often expected to fulfill the roles of armor support:
During the planning stage for an attack it was found that practically without exception the infantry commanders were reasonable in their requirements and expectations of support by the tank destroyers. But once the battle was joined, the original plans with few exceptions were often discarded and the destroyers were ordered to go forward as tanks ahead of the infantry...
When operating with armored forces, it was common to attach a company or a platoon to a tank battalion or company, and use them in an overwatch role. When operating in defense, tanks and tank destroyers were pooled as a rear-area reserve and brought into the line to blunt tank-led attacks against infantry positions.
A major lesson learned from the Italian campaign was that the conversion to towed guns was not as advantageous as had been previously thought. The mobility and protection of the tank destroyer was found to outweigh the towed anti-tank gun's low profile. At Anzio, a number of British towed anti-tank gun units were overrun and knocked out simply because they were unable to redeploy on short notice, while self-propelled guns were able to fall back and continue fighting.
In Italy, the last few M3 GMC were replaced by the M10. Although the M10 was incapable of dealing with the frontal arc of the rarely-encountered Panther tanks and Tiger tanks, it was sufficient against most enemy armor encountered in Italy, and against heavy tanks from the flank. The M18 was first deployed in the summer of 1944, and was not seen as a great success in the Italian theater; its high speed was only of limited use in the restricted terrain, and as a result it was effectively a slightly up-gunned M10.
=== Tank destroyer forces reduced ===
In August 1942, the Tank Destroyer Command was redesignated the "Tank Destroyer Center," representing a "sharp restriction of authority" to purely a training establishment, with tank destroyer battalions leaving the custody of the Center entirely after their training was finished. From a high of 220 battalions, now deemed excessive, the 1943 troop basis called for only 114. In April 1943, it was called for that only 106 battalions be activated, the number active or in the process of activation at that time. By October 1943, it was found that the need for tank destroyers overseas was far less than had been expected, and the Tank Destroyer Center began to reduce its training activities.
Thirty-five tank destroyer battalions never left the United States. Twenty-five battalions were broken up in 1943 and 1944 for their manpower, either to reinforce existing battalions, for assignment to special non-divisional infantry regiments for a six-week period of training to be converted to infantry replacements (the bulk of the battalions), or were kept occupied with miscellaneous tasks such as serving as school troops, until their inactivation. Ten battalions (not counting one that did so while overseas) were converted to other types of units, chiefly tank, amphibious tractor, or armored field artillery battalions.
=== Northwest Europe ===
By far the largest employment of tank destroyer units was in the north-western Europe campaign through France, the Low Countries and Germany. They were employed from the very beginning of the campaign, with one battalion being landed on Utah Beach in a follow-up wave on D-Day.
A revised version of Field Manual 18–5, introduced in June 1944, broadened the doctrine of tank destroyer operations. It allowed for a more dispersed deployment of the battalions throughout a force, and recommended that when enemy armor was only expected to be deployed in small groups, tank destroyers were to be distributed among forward units. It became general practice to attach a tank destroyer battalion semi-permanently to a division; this meant that it was locally available for emergencies, and that it would be able to train alongside "its" division when out of the line.
The most significant employment of tank destroyers in Normandy was in early August, at the Battle of Mortain, where the 823rd Tank Destroyer Battalion (towed 3-inch guns) was on the defensive alongside the 30th Infantry Division. The division, which was in temporary positions and not prepared for a defensive engagement, was attacked by elements of four panzer divisions on 6 August, under heavy fog. The 823rd put up a strong defense—knocking out fourteen tanks—but took heavy losses, being mostly overrun and losing eleven guns. This served to reinforce misgivings about the effectiveness of the towed units, and a report delivered to the Pentagon in December recommended they be phased out in favor of self-propelled units.
It was in France that the allies first began to face the German Panther tank.  The superior frontal armor of this tank, along with the Tiger I, Tiger II, and newer Panzerjägers, made the 75mm armed US tanks and tank destroyers less effective. The presence of these German tanks expedited the development and production of US armored vehicles armed with 90mm guns - the first to be introduced being the M36 tank destroyer.
==== Battle of the Bulge ====
In December 1944, and January 1945, the Battle of the Bulge put American ground forces on the operational defensive for the first time in Europe, as a German army group of 24 divisions (including ten panzer divisions with 1,500 armored vehicles) launched a major offensive in the Ardennes forest. The main thrust fell on the 99th and 2nd Infantry divisions which jammed the northern shoulder. A secondary attack hit two overstretched infantry divisions, both with attached towed tank destroyer battalions. Once contact was made, the towed guns were unable to reposition themselves or withdraw, and were often overrun by the enemy advance, or simply outflanked by infantry. The gun crews, unlike their self-propelled counterparts, had no protection against small-arms fire, and could easily be driven back by a squad of infantry. This lack of mobility was aggravated by the cold wet weather, and the rough conditions, which tended to bog down wheeled vehicles and immobilize fixed guns. Throughout the 1st Army as a whole, three-quarters of the tank destroyers lost were towed rather than self-propelled. One battalion, the 801st, lost 17 towed guns in just two days, while the M10-equipped 644th, which fought alongside it, found ideal opportunities for close-range ambushes and claimed 17 tanks in the same time period. It was clear that the towed guns had proved ineffective and, once the Ardennes offensive had been dealt with, the U.S. War Office approved Eisenhower's January 1945 request to convert all remaining towed units in the theatre to self-propelled guns.
Despite US forces being subjected to a major armored thrust by the Germans in the Ardennes, Tank Destroyer units were not ordered to engage the enemy according to stated doctrine. This was because most units had already been attached to Divisions and had been broken up into smaller infantry support units in a similar fashion to the way separate Tank Battalions had been. Moreover, the loss of lines of communications led to the smaller units being controlled by local commanders rather than being directed by Corps or Army commanders.
Northern Sector - Kampfgruppe Peiper
Nevertheless, tank destroyers were to be found throughout the fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, fighting at close range in broken terrain much as they had done in Italy, and, despite their shortcomings, were an essential part of the successful defense. They were widely used during the Ardennes fighting, especially in the northern sector around Malmedy, Spa, Stoumont. Large numbers were involved in several actions against the tanks of Kampfgruppe Peiper, the spearhead of the German 6. Panzer Army, around La Gleize. Elements of the 740th Tank Battalion and 823rd Tank Destroyer Battalion closed from Remouchamps were deployed into defensive positions in front of Stoumont alongside elements of the 3rd Armored division, the 30th Infantry Division and the 82nd Airborne Division.
The battle was also the first major engagement of the M36, with its 90 mm gun; the three battalions employed (the 610th,  703rd, and the 740th Tank Destroyer Battalions) proved highly effective. The M36 was beginning to be introduced in number when the offensive began, and was important throughout the entire Ardennes offensive.
Southern Sector - Bastogne
The 705th, equipped with M18s, fought alongside the 101st Airborne at the siege of Bastogne, and played a key role in the defense of the town. Four M-18s, along with some M4 medium tanks and infantry from the 10th Armored division, occupied Noville, just north of Bastogne, and stopped a German armored attack with flank fires, killing 30 heavy tanks (Panthers and Tigers). Once surrounded, the actions of mobile Tank Destroyers within Bastogne was similar to stated doctrine - whenever German attacks threatened the front lines, tank destroyer units (along with US tanks) would rush to the area from behind and intercept invading armor. Because of the shortness of the interior lines within the besieged Bastogne, Tank Destroyer units could be directed very quickly to any location in response to a German attack and prevented any breakthrough.
The battle also highlighted the defensive nature of Tank Destroyer tactics compared to regular armored units. During Team Desobry's initial occupation of Noville, a number of US tanks and tank destroyers were firing into advancing units of the 2nd Panzer Division. However, so many targets were appearing that the M4 tanks from CCB of 10th Armored were staying in place and not moving. By contrast, the M18s from the 609th Tank Destroyer Battalion made frequent changes in location after firing. As a result, tank losses were high while Tank Destroyer losses were comparatively low.
Central Sector - St. Vith
The mobile defense of the Battle of St. Vith involved M36 tank Destroyers from the 814th Tank Destroyer Battalion blunting German armored thrusts. Once these thrusts were halted, tank companies from the 7th Armored Division would counter-attack. This tactic allowed a gradual retreat of US forces, ceding only a few kilometers a day, and was instrumental in ruining the plans of advancing German forces.
While the tank destroyers were broadly used in their intended role in the Ardennes—being used as a reserve to counter a massed armored attack – there were two significant differences between their use and the original doctrine. Firstly, there was no central strategic reserve—most tank destroyer battalions were assigned to divisions and kept near the front line, rather than massed in the rear. Secondly, the battalions were rarely committed as a whole; as had become common, they were effectively used as local anti-tank assets, with a platoon or a company assigned to an infantry battalion to bolster its defensive strength.
==== Infantry support ====
After losses in the Battle of the Bulge, German armored capability in the West was seriously weakened, both through combat losses and through logistical limitations. As such, the tank destroyer battalions spent the closing months of the war as mobile support units, broadly distributed into secondary roles.
As a result, mobile tank destroyer forces generally operated in the same way as the separate tank battalion - being used as direct fire support for infantry operations across a broad front. But while tanks were effective in this role, the tank destroyers were handicapped by their open turrets and thin armor, making them more vulnerable to enemy fire. Moreover, the speed advantage that some tank destroyers had over tanks did not translate into a tactical advantage since such support operations moved at the speed of foot infantry. Infantry units did, however, appreciate the support of tank destroyers in lieu of available tanks.
The remaining towed tank destroyer battalions were generally attached to infantry divisions in more static areas, offering limited direct fire support in the same way as the mobile battalions, or else being attached to divisional artillery to augment indirect fire missions. Most of the towed battalions were gradually refitted with mobile units after the Ardennes and retrained.
By the war's end, infantry division commanders "unanimously agreed that they would prefer to have the support of a tank battalion instead of a tank destroyer battalion." The result was a belief that each infantry division would have its own dedicated battalion of three tank companies, with each company serving each of the three Infantry Regiments. This made the tank destroyer doctrine obsolete, since tanks themselves could also serve in the role of a mobile anti-tank defense against any potential enemy armored thrust, a tactic that had been proven during the Ardennes.
=== Pacific campaign ===
A small number of tank destroyer battalions served in the South-West Pacific; due to the lack of Japanese armor, these were employed almost entirely in the infantry support role, effectively acting as highly mobile artillery. Due to their open-topped turrets, the tank destroyers were far more vulnerable than tanks to close-assault tactics used by the Japanese infantry.
== Tank destroyer forces disbanded ==
The US Army finished the war with 63 active tank destroyer battalions, mostly self-propelled.
While tank destroyers had proven their versatility and efficiency in combat, especially in secondary roles, their long-term utility was becoming doubtful by 1945 in light of changes to Army doctrine. Their primary role was to destroy enemy armor, but this role was being usurped by tanks, as had already happened in many other armies. The most powerful tank destroyer to be fielded, the M36, mounted a 90 mm gun; the same armament was carried by the M26 Pershing heavy tank, which was beginning to reach front-line units by the end of hostilities. The M26 was redesignated as a medium tank shortly after the end of the war, becoming the standard vehicle of armored units, and further reducing the need for any specialist anti-tank capacity. In effect, tank destroyers were used just like tanks in many cases. Study of ammunition expenditures shows that tank destroyers in Europe fired about 11 rounds of high-explosive (HE) ammunition for every round of armor-piercing (AP) ammunition, showing that they were used for general support duties far more often than as anti-tank assets.
Moreover, the tactics that underpinned the creation and training of tank destroyer battalions had been undone by the experiences of the Ardennes. Stopping or slowing a blitzkrieg style armored thrust became the responsibility of combined-arms formations, in which infantry, artillery and armor worked together in a mobile defense. While tank destroyers made up an important part of such a defense, it became clear that tanks were better suited because of their all-round ability to counter-attack an enemy, as well as provide a mobile defense, of which they were equal to the tank destroyers (with the exception of the M36). Tank destroyers, being lightly armored, were not suited to a counter-attacking role, and were limited to providing mobile defense only. The confusion of the Ardennes battle also resulted in the creation of many ad hoc infantry/armor formations, which was in contrast to the tactic of having tank destroyers in a well-organized formation situated well back from the front lines. The result of this experience led military strategists to conclude that neither static anti-tank positions at the front line, nor mobile battalion-sized tank destroyer units operating in the rear, were the best solution to enemy armored thrusts.
Defensive measures were also informed by the experience of Soviet Deep operation activities on the Eastern Front. Seen especially in the Battle of Kursk, large numbers of Soviet infantry and armor were arranged in various deep echelons to blunt German advances and prevent breakthroughs.
In addition, the Army was reducing its size very rapidly after the end of hostilities; the tank destroyer branch cost the equivalent of three or four full divisions, a definite luxury for a non-essential service. The 1945 General Board report "Study of Organization, Equipment, and Tactical Employment of Tank Destroyer Units" led to the disbandment of Tank Destroyer Battalions, and on 10 November 1945, the Tank Destroyer Center was closed, effectively ending the long-term prospects of the force. The last battalion was de-activated in 1946.
== Vehicles ==
US Tank Destroyer doctrine called for mobile units to quickly move to a given position, fire upon enemy armor once they were within range, and then to retreat quickly and take up another position when endangered by enemy fire. Design specifications were thus geared towards speed and mobility, turreted armament capable of defeating enemy armor, and only enough armor to resist small arms fire. This was in contrast to the slower Russian and German tank destroyers, which were heavy armed and armored and were built without turrets.
Some early units were equipped with towed 37 mm guns, but this was quickly abandoned. In addition to the 75 mm-equipped M3 GMC, the original attempt to produce a tank destroyer, a vehicle was developed utilizing the common 37mm anti-tank gun. This was designated the M6 GMC, and was simply a 3/4 ton truck with a 37 mm gun mounted in the rear compartment. A large number were produced, equipping one platoon in each company, but this was abandoned after November 1942 and the vehicles exchanged for M3 GMCs. The M6 saw only limited service in North Africa, and was declared obsolescent in 1943. A few were used by Free French forces in Europe in 1944–45, and the 37mm gun mounts were added to a few M2 halftracks at the unit level.
The deficiencies of the M3 GMC were quickly noted in the 1941 maneuver, and the experience gained allowed a "perfect" advanced tank destroyer to be planned, one which would give a high priority to speed. However, it would take some time to be developed, and a simpler design was looked for as a stopgap. It was decided to take the proven M4 Sherman chassis and give it a modified 3 inch high-velocity anti-aircraft gun; the resulting combination was designated the M10 gun motor carriage. Compromises were made to the vehicle; the turret was left open and lightly armored, keeping the weight low in order to prioritize the speed of the vehicle. A small number were used in North Africa, and it became a standard vehicle thereafter.
The experience of employing the M3, M6, and M10 GMCs in North Africa all fed into the plans for the next generation tank destroyer, which eventually saw service as the M18, nicknamed the "Hellcat". It was equipped with a newly designed 76 mm gun—firing the same shell (from a different cartridge case) as that on the M10—mounted on an all-new chassis. This new design allowed it to be ten tonnes lighter than the M10, which allowed for a remarkable road speed of over 50 mph. However, it was still lightly armored—indeed, it had only half the armor of the M10—and suffered many of the survivability problems of its predecessors. The M18 began to see service in mid-1944.
The final tank destroyer to enter service was the M36. This was a development of the M10 hull with a new turret mounting a 90 mm high-velocity gun, the most powerful anti-tank weapon which would be carried by American forces in Europe. A prototype was originally constructed in 1942, as an experiment, and the design was standardized in June 1944. In July, the European command requested that all M10 battalions be converted to M36s, and the first vehicles reached the front lines in September. It proved more than capable of countering heavy tanks – it was recorded as disabling a Panther tank at 3,200 yards – and its roots in the M10 meant that it possessed greater survivability than the M18. A modification of the M18 upgunned to 90mm was never approved for series production.
=== Design ===
All the US tank destroyers were built without turret roofs. This was done to save weight but also allowed a wider field of view to spot enemy armor and quicker ammunition stowage. The drawbacks included vulnerability to small arms fire (especially from elevated positions), grenades, and splinters from air bursting artillery. Exposure to wind, rain, snow and freezing temperatures also made operations difficult, and many tank destroyer crews placed tarpaulins or other material over the turret to improve both their comfort and their operational effectiveness. Other significant differences between tank destroyers and tanks was that tank destroyers lacked coaxial and bow .30-caliber machine guns. This reduced their ability for infantry support and close-in self defense. Tank destroyers did retain a turret top .50-caliber machine gun as did medium tanks and useful for reconnaissance by fire and self defense.
== Battalion numbering ==
Under the initial scheme outlined in December 1941, when antitank battalions created from assets that came from infantry divisions were converted to tank destroyer battalions, they received a number in the 600 range. Antitank battalions created from armored division assets received numbers in the 700s. Separate infantry antitank battalions (irrespective of the arm of the cadre source) and those created from antitank assets of non-divisional field artillery units received numbers in the 800s. Towed and self-propelled units were often noted by (T) or (SP) being appended to the number.

Pomoriany Castle (Ukrainian: Поморянський замок, Pomorians'kyi zamok, Polish: Zamek w Pomorzanach) is a ruined castle in the urban-type settlement of Pomoriany, Zolochiv Raion, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. It originated in the 16th century as a well-fortified noble residence on the bank of the Zolota Lypa River. The castle's early owners included Mikołaj Świnka and Jan Sienieński.
The estate suffered badly at the hands of the Cossacks and Turks (1675, 1684) but Jan III Sobieski invested in the restoration in order to make Pomorzany one of his country residences. Sobieski's death in 1696 was followed by another long period of decline.
A real change came about in the castle's fortunes when, in 1789, Erasm Pruszyński started transforming the dilapidated building into a modern residence. He had the barbican gate, three towers and several wings of the old structure torn down, however.
As recently as 1939, Pomorzany was owned by the famous Potocki family. Following the September Campaign, the building was adapted for use as a school, but it was finally abandoned to rot in the late 1970s.

Alan Gerald Bernard Old (born 23 September 1945) is an English rugby union player who had 16 caps for England.
Old was an undergraduate at Queen Mary College and later studied for a year at Durham University, where he competed for Durham University RFC. In 1970 he was selected for North-Eastern Counties in their match against South Africa at Gosforth, part of the controversial 1969–70 South Africa rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland.
He made his debut for England against Wales in 1972 and made a further 15 appearances with his final one being against France in 1978. His 16 caps included four wins, although these were against New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and Wales. Old also played in the famous victory of the North of England over the touring All Blacks at Otley in 1979 with the English regional side running out 21-9 winners.
Old was selected for the 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa but was replaced by Phil Bennett at fly-half after sustaining an injury. He played in only four matches on the tour, scoring a then-record 37 points in the match against South West Districts. His tour was ended by a serious leg injury in the match against the Proteas.
He was often more admired by England fans than by the selectors. On one occasion, a fan was so enraged when a player whom he considered to be inferior was selected in Old's place that he reputedly composed a letter of complaint pointing out the many ways in which Old would have been a better choice and then sent a copy to each member of the selection committee, written in Braille.
Old is the brother of former England fast bowler Chris Old, and the brothers achieved a notable feat when Alan represented his country against Scotland at Murrayfield, whilst Chris was playing for England against the West Indies in the Caribbean. Alan was also a cricketer, playing 40 Minor County matches for Durham between 1968 and 1978 and one 2nd X1 appearance for Middlesex against Kent in 1970.  He also played in one first-class match for Warwickshire against Cambridge University in 1969.
After the end of his playing career, Alan Old became a successful educationalist, serving as the Principal of Cleveland Technical College, having already been a master at Worksop College and a mathematics teacher at Myers Grove Comprehensive in Sheffield 
Sir William Turner's Grammar School, Redcar during his playing career.

James Lyman Hetland, Jr. (1926 - May 23, 2012) was selected to be the founding chair of the Metropolitan Council in 1967 by Gov. Harold LeVander.
He led the Twin cities in a regionalisation effort for the seven-county metro area. One of his major projects in the first years of the Met Council was the placement of the South St. Paul Municipal Airport. At the time, the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) wanted it located in Ham Lake, adjacent to the Carlos Avery Game Farm. The Met Council, under Hetland's leadership, vetoed the location and chose Minneapolis rival St. Paul. His decision was due to the ecologically sensitive nature of the MAC preferred site's surrounding area.
== Biography ==
Hetland joined the Army out of high school and served during World War II. He later earned a law degree from the University of Minnesota Law School, graduating first in his class. He clerked for Supreme Court Justice Thomas F. Gallagher of the Minnesota Supreme Court and then went into private practice.
In addition to serving the Met Council from 1967 to 1971, he was active in many boards and committees. He served as chair of the National Municipal League and the Citizens Forum on Self Governance and had roles in the Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure of the Minnesota Supreme Court, the Minnesota Zoological Garden, the Minneapolis Charter Commission, The Council on Crime and Justice, and the Minneapolis Downtown Association. He was also a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and at William Mitchell College of Law.

Marketta Ristontytär Punasuomalainen (1600–1658), was a Finnish cunning woman and an alleged witch. She was one of the first people executed for sorcery in Finland (which then was a part of Sweden) and also perhaps one of the best known victims of the witch hunt in present-day Finland.
== Biography ==
Marketta and her husband, Simo Antinpoika, owned a farm in Ruovesi. During the 1630s, they were forced to leave their farm in the 1630s, and made a living as travelling beggars in the country around the city of Vasa (Fi. Vaasa). They often stayed around the Vasa region and supported themselves with various temporary jobs. Marketta also worked as a cunning woman.
The couple was surrounded by rumors of witchcraft. There was a history of witchcraft in her family, as the uncle of her husband had been accused of sorcery in 1624. Marketta worked in herbal medicine, and had the reputation of being a magician, something she encouraged and attempted to use for her benefit.
The farmers began to fear her. In 1655, a complaint was filed against her by the peasants to the bishop, describing their fear of her sorcery. Church of Sweden Lutheran minister Jacob Vasenius called on the public to arrest her. Witnesses heard Marketta make threats against him, and he died shortly after. A man made threats against her while she was begging, and afterwards his baby became ill. Several people became sick or died after a conflict with her, which was believed to be due to her enchanting them. 
She was arrested and brought to trial in Vasa in 1657. When she was put on trial, she was accused of making babies sick, enchanting beer, creating sickness, and killing two men with magic. She responded that she had never harmed anyone, but the public opinion demanded a conviction, and she was judged guilty and sentenced to be decapitated and burnt at the stake.
Both her husband and her daughter, Katarina, were also accused of sorcery, but acquitted from the charges.

The ownership of Arsenal F.C. and Arsenal W.F.C. is considerably different from that of other clubs in English football for men and women. It is owned by a parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, which has relatively few shares which are infrequently traded. Historically, the club has been owned by descendants of the Bracewell-Smith and Hill-Wood families.  The club attracted outside interest as two rival tycoons, Stan Kroenke and Alisher Usmanov, acquired significant share holdings in 2007. In August 2018, Kroenke's offer of £550 million for Usmanov's share was accepted, and Kroenke bought out the remainder of the shares to become the club's sole shareholder.
== Overview ==
Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,217 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on NEX Exchange (AFC), a specialist market. The 2011 takeover bid by Stan Kroenke put the club's market capitalisation value at £731m.
Arsenal Holdings plc wholly owns twelve subsidiary companies, covering the group's activities. These include Arsenal Football Club plc (the football club itself), Arsenal (Emirates Stadium) Limited (which develops and owns Arsenal's Emirates Stadium), Arsenal Stadium Management Company (which manages the stadium on matchdays), and Arsenal Overseas Ltd (which manages retail operations). Other subsidiaries deal with property development on the site of Arsenal's former stadium at Highbury and the associated property holding and financing.
== Financial performance ==
The club made an operating profit (excluding player transfers) of £72m in the year ending 31 May 2010, from a turnover of £379.9m. In April 2009, business magazine Forbes ranked Arsenal as third most valuable football team in the world, after Manchester United and Real Madrid, valuing the club at $1.2bn (£605m), excluding debt. Accountants Deloitte rated Arsenal fifth in the 2011 Deloitte Football Money League, a ranking of the world's football clubs in terms of revenue, with the club earning £274.1m in the 2009–10 season.
== History ==
As an amateur club, Royal Arsenal FC, Arsenal started out as a mutually owned club but after turning professional, converted to a limited liability company in 1893. The company struggled in the club's early years, with its location in industrial Woolwich resulting in low attendances. The club was liquidated and reformed in 1910, and taken over by the owner of Fulham FC, Henry Norris. Norris owned the club for the next nineteen years, moving it to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury in 1913. Norris however was forced to resign as chairman and left Arsenal in 1929 following an expenses scandal.
By the time of World War II the majority of Arsenal shares were held by Samuel Hill-Wood and Sir Bracewell Smith, the MP for Holborn and a future Lord Mayor of London. In those days the shares were not considered to be valuable and had never paid a dividend, and were seen largely as a charitable exercise to provide recreational entertainment for the working people of North London.
After his death, the shareholding of Sir Bracewell Smith was divided between his son and daughter and ended up in the hands of his grandchildren, Sir Charles Bracewell-Smith, Clive Carr (Life-President), Richard Carr and Sarah Carr, now Lady Phipps-Bagge. Samuel Hill-Wood's shares passed first to his son Denis and then his grandson and former Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood; he sold much of his family's shareholdings in the 1980s to David Dein, who sold some of them on to Danny Fiszman (a London diamond dealer). In the early 2000s the club sold a 9.9% stake to Granada Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of ITV plc, and a significant stake was also bought by hedge fund Lansdowne Partners.
== Current shareholders ==
As of 26 September 2018, Stan Kroenke, is the sole owner of Kroenke Sports Enterprises (KSE).
Kroenke's holdings in the club began with an initial 9.9% bought from ITV plc in April 2007; initially treated with hostility, he is now regarded as an ally of the Arsenal board and was appointed a non-executive director of the club in September 2008. Kroenke brought his stake in the club up to 20.5% following a purchase of shares from fellow director Danny Fiszman. On 1 May 2009, Arsenal announced that Kroenke had bought a further 4,839 shares from the Carr family, including Richard Carr, also a director, which made him the largest shareholder of the company with 28.3%. On November the same year, this increased to the maximum 29.9% limit.
A rival bid for the club came from Red & White Holdings, which was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and London-based financier Farhad Moshiri. Red & White bought the stake held by former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, as well as stakes owned by Lansdowne and many other minor shareholders, and as of September 2011 own 18,204 shares (29.25%) of the club. This is the largest single stake owned by a non-board member. This led to press speculation of a bidding war between Kroenke and Usmanov. However, Kroenke agreed not to purchase more than 29.9% of the club until at least September 2009, while the rest of the board agreed not to consider a sale of their shares to "non-permitted persons" until at least April 2009, and had first option on each other's shares until October 2012.
In April 2011, Kroenke extended his ownership of the club by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith (15.9%), Danny Fiszman (16.11%) and other directors of the Arsenal board, taking his shareholding to 66.64%. Under the Takeover Code, Kroenke, as majority shareholder, was obliged to make an offer for the remaining shares in the club, which would include those owned by Red & White Holdings as well as any stakes held by the remaining minority shareholders of the club;  these include those owned by former players as well as three shares owned by the Arsenal Supporters' Trust. Kroenke moved forward with this in August 2018 by purchasing Usmanov's stake.
In March 2023, Stan and Josh Kroenke were appointed co-chairmen in a board restructuring, with Director Tim Lewis becoming executive vice chairman

Yoshimi Takeuchi (竹内 好, Takeuchi Yoshimi, born October 1910 — 3 March 1977) was a Japanese Sinologist.
== Biography ==
Yoshimi Takeuchi was a Sinologist, a cultural critic and translator. He studied Chinese author Lu Xun and translated Lu's works into Japanese. His book-length study, Lu Xun (1944) ignited a significant reaction in the world of Japanese thought during and after the Pacific War. Takeuchi formed a highly successful Chinese literature study group with Taijun Takeda in 1934 and this is regarded as the beginning of modern Sinology in Japan. He was a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University from 1953 to 1960 when he resigned in protest. He was known as a distinguished critic of Sino-Japanese issues and his complete works (vols. 17) were published by Chikuma Shobo during 1980–82.
In 1931, Takeuchi graduated from high school and entered the faculty of letters at Tokyo Imperial University, where he met his lifelong friend, Taijun Takeda. Together they formed the Chinese Literature Research Society (Chugoku Bungaku Kenkyukai) and in 1935, they published an official organ for the group, Chugoku Bungaku Geppo in order to open up the study of contemporary Chinese literature as opposed to the "old-style" Japanese Sinology. During 1937 to 1939 he studied abroad in Beijing where he became depressed due to the  geo-political situation and drank heavily. In 1940, he changed the title of the official organ from Chugoku Bungaku Geppo to Chugoku Bungaku in which he published a controversial article, "The Greater East Asia War and our resolve" in January 1942. In January 1943, he broke up the Chinese Literature Research Society and decided to discontinue the publication of Chugoku Bungaku despite the group becoming quite successful. In December, he was called up for the Chinese front and stayed there until 1946. This encounter with what he saw as the real living China and Chinese people, as opposed to the abstract China of his studies, made a deep impression on him. He threw himself into a study of the modern colloquial language and during this time, his maiden work was published, the book-length study Lu Xun (1944).
After repatriation, his essays On leader consciousness and What is modernity? became the focus of public attention in 1948 during the Japanese occupation. It is from such essays that his status as an important postwar critic was gradually acknowledged. After 1949, he was greatly moved by the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and he continued to refer to the PRC in his articles and books. In 1953, he became a full professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University, a post he eventually resigned from in protest after Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke rammed the revised U.S.-Japan Security Treaty through the National Diet with only members of his own party present in May 1960 despite the massive Anpo Protests expressing popular opposition to the new treaty. During the anti-treaty struggle, Takeuchi played a leading role as one of the foremost intellectuals in postwar Japan under the slogan he coined: "democracy or dictatorship?" From 1963, he argued in favor of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Cultural Revolution in his magazine Chugoku published by Chugoku no Kai until the diplomatic normalization between Japan and the PRC (1972). He was particularly interested in Mao's "Philosophy of base/ground" (konkyochi tetsugaku) which involves the principle of making one's enemy one's own. For Takeuchi, this was similar to Lu Xun's notion of cheng-cha, or endurance/resistance. In his later years, Takeuchi devoted himself to doing a new translation of Lu Xun's works.
== Yu Dafu ==
In his graduation thesis, Takeuchi discussed Yu Dafu. He concluded:
Yu Dafu—he was an agonal poet. He pursued self-agony with a sincere manner and brought abnormal influence in the Chinese literary world by coming to light in bold expression. Because his agony sums up his young contemporaries' agony.
"Not <politics> (accommodating oneself to external authority) but <literature> (digging down self-agony). Yu Dafu did not reign over the people but was connected with others' agony. Takeuchi described his style as 'art of the strength that devoting oneself solely to weakness'."

=== Shina and Chugoku ===
Takeuchi felt guilty about the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. At that time, Tokyo called China as not "Shina" but "Chugoku" for directing friendship between Japan and the Wang Jingwei regime. In Japanese, "Shina" is a discriminatory word for China. Takeuchi attempted to culturally resist such a manner in a period of a total war.
However, as he knew the Greater East Asia War was also to some extent intended and characterized as a war to liberate East and Southeast Asian nations, Takeuchi pathetically declared his resolve (1942) for what he saw as a war of justice, which is generally interpreted as his cooperation with the war effort. After defeat in 1945, however, he knew that the declared aims of the war were deceptive and he tried to explain its aporias of both the liberation of colonies and anti-imperialism.
=== Overcoming modernity ===
"Overcoming modernity" was one of the catchwords that took hold of Japanese intellectuals during the war. Or perhaps it was one of the magic words. "Overcoming modernity" served as a symbol that was associated with the "Greater East Asian War".
In denouncing the intelligentsia for their wartime collaboration, it is common to lump these two symposiums together.
Rather my task is to distinguish among the symbolization of the symposiums, its ideas, and those who exploited these ideas.
It is difficult if not virtually impossible to strip the ideology from ideas, or to extract the ideas from ideology. But we must recognize the relative independence of ideas from the systems or institutions that exploit them, we must risk the difficulty of distinguishing the actual ideas. Otherwise it would be impossible to draw forth the energy buried within them. In other words, it would be impossible to form tradition. 
After the defeat of 1945, Japanese journalism was full of discussion surrounding the issue of war responsibility, particularly that intellectuals and a famous wartime symposium entitled "Overcoming Modernity" which involved literary critic, Kobayashi Hideo and Kyoto-school philosopher, Nishida Kitaro. Wartime intellectuals were classified into three groups: Literary World, the "Japanese Romantics" (such as Yasuda Yojiro) and the Kyoto School. The "Overcoming Modernity" symposium was held in wartime Japan in (1942) and sought to interpret Japanese imperialism’s Asian mission in a positive historical light, as not any kind of simple fawning on Fascism, but rather ultimately, a step in the proper direction of Japan's destiny as an integral part of Asia. This was only a step, however, as, according to Takeuchi, while highlighting the aporias of modernity, the "Overcoming Modernity" debates failed to make those aporias themselves the subject of thought.
Critic Odagiri Hideo criticized the symposium as an "ideological campaign consisting in the defense and theorization of the militaristic tennō state and the submission to its war system". His view was accepted widely in post-war Japan. However, Takeuchi strongly opposed this easy pseudo-leftist formula.
The Pacific War's dual aspects of colonial invasion and anti-imperialism were united, and it was by this time impossible to separate these aspects.
For the Kyoto School, it was dogma that was important; they were indifferent to reality. I don't even think that they represented a "defense of the fait accompli that might makes right." These philosophers disregarded the facts.
Yasuda was at one and the same time a "born demagogue" and a "spiritual treasure"; he could not have been a spiritual treasure were he not also a demagogue. This is the Japanese spirit itself. Yasuda represents something illimitable, he is an extreme type of Japanese universalist from which there is no escape. ... The intellectual role played by Yasuda was that of eradicating thought through the destruction of all categories. ... This may be the voice of heaven or earth, but it is not human language. It must be a revelation of the "souls of our Imperial ancestors." There is not even any usage of the "imperial we." This is a medium. And the role that everyone had "eagerly anticipated" was that of the medium itself, who appears at the end as the "lead actor in a great farce." Yasuda played this role brilliantly. By destroying all values and categories of thought, he relieved the thinking subject of all responsibility.
Kobayashi Hideo was able to divest all meaning from facts, but he could not go beyond this. Literary World could only wait for the "medium" that was Yasuda to come and announce the disarmament of ideas.
In sum, the "Overcoming Modernity" symposium marked the final attempt at forming thought, an attempt that, however, failed. Such formation of thought would at least take as its point of departure the aim of transforming the logic of total war. It failed in that it ended in the destruction of thought. 
In wartime 1942, Takeuchi declared a resolve on the war without fanatical chauvinism. In the postwar, Takeuchi's discussion was centred on the dual aspects of the Greater East Asia War. He attempted to resist war characteristics by using his own logic. However, for him, the wartime symposiums failed in the end. "Overcoming Modernity" resulted in scholastic chaos. Kobayashi Hideo of Literary World, who beat "World-Historical Standpoint" of the Kyoto School, was unworthy at this time. On behalf of such Kobayashi, Yasuda Yojuro of the Japanese Romantics showed only contempt.
=== National literature criticism ===
During 1951 to 1953, Takeuchi argued with literary critic, Sei Itō over the nature of a national literature (cf. Treaty of San Francisco). In 1954, Takeuchi published Kokumin Bungaku-ron [Theory of a national literature]. He criticized Japanese modernism for avoiding the problem of the "nation". Takeuchi envisaged national literature as needing to address the aporia of the nation as a cultural practice.
=== Foresight and mistakes ===
In 1960, the Japanese government rammed a revised version of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security through the House of Representatives. Takeuchi saw it undemocratic and he decided to resign as professor of Tokyo Metropolitan University. Takeuchi attempted to generalize war experiences of the Japanese people to establish Japanese democratic subjectivity. As a result, he failed to accomplish his goal. Takeuchi said, "Now, I think the Japanese nation will die out. Maybe, there is a possibility to be restored to life in the future. However, Japan is stateless in the present."
== "Asia as method" ==
=== Lu Xun ===
"According to Takeuchi, the core part of Lu Xun 'is awareness of the literature which was acquired through a confrontation with politics'. Literature in itself is directly powerless. However, as a result, literature could be involved in politics by devoting literature to literature. A writer could be powerful if he would dig down mental "darkness" and realize self-denial and self-innovation without dependence. Lu Xun was aware of this, so Takeuchi calls it "reform" ('eshin').
=== Chinese modernity and Japanese modernity ===
For Takeuchi, Japanese society was authoritarian and discriminatory. Takeuchi criticized Japanese modernists and modernization theorists who adopted a stopgap measure and recognized Japan as superior to Asia aiming at though revolutions. Takeuchi argued that Chinese modernity qualitatively surpassed the Japanese model. However, those modernists looked down on Asia and concluded Japan was not Asian. Generally speaking, the Japanese Meiji modernists had a tendency to interpret Asia as backward.
For Takeuchi, Japan and his greatest "darkness" were nothing but the issue of war responsibility. In What is modernity? (1948), Takeuchi stated:
"Ultranationalism and Japanism were once fashionable. These were to have banished Europe; they were not to have banished the slave structure that accommodates Europe. Now modernism is fashionable as a reaction against these ideologies, but the structure that accommodates modernity is still not problematized. Japan, in other words, attempts to replace the master; it does not seek independence. This is equivalent to treating Tojo Hideki as a backward student, so that other honor students remain in power in order to preserve the honor student culture itself.  It is impossible to negate Tojo by opposing him: one must go beyond him. To accomplish this, however, one must even utilize him."
"<Class-A war criminals> and <Non-class-A war criminals> are supplement relations. It is meaningless to declare 'Japanism' to oppose with the West. Likewise, it is meaningless to declare Western modernism to oppose with 'Japanism'. In order to deny <Tojo>, you must not oppose with <Tojo> and must surpass <Tojo> by facing up to your image of <Tojo>. And it was equal to war-time Takeuchi himself who adopted <December 8> and criticized the Greater East Asia Writers' Congress.
=== Japanese Asianism ===
Takeuchi admitted modern Japanese Asianism ended with an empty official slogan "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and Japanese defeat of 1945 after all. In post-war Japan, the Greater East Asia War thoroughly denied at all. Takeuchi questioned Japanese pacifism which led to lose the attitudes and responsibilities towards Asia as an Asian nation. Takeuchi depressed such a situation. He set to reviewing Japanese modern history through Asianism.
Takeuchi edited an anthology of Asianism in which he commented that Asianism is not an ideology but a trend and that it is impossible to distinguish between "invasion" and "solidarity" in Japanese Asianism. He explained that "Asianism" originated from Tokichi Tarui and Yukichi Fukuzawa in the 1880s. The former Tarui argued for unionizing Japan and Korea equally to strengthen Greater East Asian security. Takeuchi appreciated Tarui's work as an unprecedented masterpiece. The latter Fukuzawa argued for Japan casting off Asia who was barbarian and vulgar company. Takeuchi appreciated Fukuzawa's article as a stronger appeal to the public than Tarui's. The victories of the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War made Japanese solidarity with Asia further and further. After the victories of the above wars, Japan inclined to build a "new order" in East Asia. Japan could not be a hope of Asia. Takeuchi indicated Japanese structural defect derived from wrong honours. He interpreted Japanese Asianism as Ko-A (raising Asia) taken over Datsu-A (casting off Asia).
For Takeuchi, Asia is not a geographical concept but a concept against "modern Europe", and so, Japan is non-Asian. When the Japanese accomplish to overcome modernity, they can be Asian. By "modern Europe", it is feudal class society full of discrimination and authoritarianism. "Asia" could be liberation from imperialism, which cut off a relationship between dominant and subject. Perhaps, his views were non-realist and progressive in a sense.
Takeuchi wished Japan to be Asianized. The concept of Asia is nothing but an ideal for him. He said: "In a political dimension, post-war Bandung conference made an idea of Asianness in history". Referring to Rabindranath Tagore and Lu Xun, Takeuchi addressed:
Rather the Orient must re-embrace the West, it must change the West itself in order to realize the latter's outstanding cultural values on a greater scale. Such a rollback of culture or values would create universality. The Orient must change the West in order to further elevate those universal values that the West itself produced. This is the main problem facing East-West relations today, and it is at once a political and cultural issue. 
=== The origin of peace ===
After 1945, Takeuchi has called upon the normalization between China and Japan. In 1972, the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China was concluded. Takeuchi criticized the Japanese attitudes towards the past. The issues of history have been a big concern in the Sino-Japanese relations.

The Confederate government of Missouri was a continuation in exile of the government of pro-Confederate Governor Claiborne F. Jackson. It existed until General E. Kirby Smith surrendered all Confederate troops west of the Mississippi River at New Orleans, May 26, 1865.
== History ==
As the Civil War began, many leading citizens were hoping the state could remain neutral in the growing conflict.  These hopes were encompassed in the so-called Price–Harney Truce of May 21, 1861.  Implementation of the truce fell prey, however, to the growing conflict.  At a meeting held at Planters' House in St. Louis, June 11, 1861, it became clear that leading Missourians would have to choose sides.  In the fall of 1861, Governor Claiborne Jackson and other leading Missouri secessionists met in Neosho, Missouri.  Acting as the Missouri General Assembly, this body enacted an ordinance of secession on October 28, 1861; however, the legal status of this ordinance was not accepted by Missouri's Union supporters, then or later.
The secession government applied for and, on November 28, 1861, was granted admission to the Confederacy as its purported 12th state.  As a result of military operations, however, particularly the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862, the Confederate government of Missouri was not able to establish control over much of the state; its jurisdiction extended only as far as Confederate military strength could reach. Governor Jackson and his government were forced into exile. The exiled government established operations in Marshall, Texas, as part of the Trans-Mississippi bloc of Southern civil governments.
Although Confederate supporters in Missouri were unable to make good on their secession, the Southern government-in-exile sent legislators to the Congress of the Confederate States, and Missouri was represented by the twelfth star on the Confederate flag.

Chase Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico was founded in 1867 by Manly and Theresa Chase. As pioneers, from Wisconsin by way of Colorado, they crossed the Raton Pass in a covered wagon and establish a new home in New Mexico. Manly Chase purchased the land from Lucien Maxwell, part of the Maxwell Land Grant. The ranch is near the Ponil Creek, a mile north of the Cimarron River, not far from the Santa Fe Trail. The Ranch included the old Kit Carson homestead. Before the arrival of pioneers, the land was populated by Apaches and Ute people. Manly provided the local Native Americans with beef, creating peaceful coexistence.
== Background ==
Manly Chase (b. 1842) started with a sheep ranch.  By 1875, he started raising cattle with Texas Longhorns and Corriente cattle. Hereford cattle were introduced onto the ranch in 1883. Manly also planted an apple orchard that continues today. Manly and Theresa Chase raised six children in their 14-room ranch house. 
The Chase Ranch is famous for its heart-shaped brand and allegedly the Marlboro Man's place of origin. Much is known about the Chase family as Manly Chase wrote more than 70 books of records, including several daily diaries that are now in the New Mexico State University Library. 
The Chase Ranch remained a family-owned ranch run by Chase descendants. This ended in August 2012, when Manly and Theresa's great-granddaughter Gretchen Sammis died.  After Gretchen’s death, ownership of the ranch changed to the Chase Ranch Foundation. Gretchen had created the foundation to preserve the 11,000-acre ranch and her family’s heritage. Gretchen Sammis owned and operated the ranch for 58 years. Long before her death in August 2012, she had drafted the Chase Ranch Foundation paperwork. She wanted the Chase Ranch to educate young people in ranching. She was secretary of the Cimarron School Board, a member of the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame and 2007 New Mexico Cattleman of the year. She was appointed to the New Mexico Soil and Water Conservation Commission, the agriculture advisory committee to the state land office, and the New Mexico Resource Advisory Council.  
On October 21, 2013, the Chase Ranch Foundation and the Boy Scouts of America signed an agreement for Philmont Scout Ranch to keep the ranch running and to preserve historic structures, manage a Chase museum, to create and run educational programs through living history presentations of New Mexico and American Southwest history, and to run a working cattle ranch with Gretchen's favorite breed, Herefords. Chase Ranch is adjacent to Philmont Scout Ranch. Beginning November 1, 2013, Philmont Scout Ranch gives tours of the main Chase house, Chase grounds, Chase orchards and Chase's tack room during the summer. The BSA has also installed restrooms and a picnic area at the Chase Ranch.
Chase Ranch is near New Mexico State Road 204, in the 87714 zip code and 575 area code

The Skeoch was a Scottish cyclecar manufactured in 1921 by Skeoch Utility Car Company in Dalbeattie, Kirkudbrightshire.  It was powered by a 348 cc single-cylinder Precision engine and was fitted with a two-speed Burman gearbox with chain for its final-drive. 
At the Scottish Motor Show in 1921, the first Skeoch Utility Car was the cheapest on display and sold for £180 complete, or at a reduced cost of £165 without accessories. Around 10 were manufactured before the factory "The Burnside Motor Works" was destroyed by fire in December 1921.
On Saturday 17 July 2021 a recreation of the car was revealed at Colliston Park, Dalbeattie. The fully operative replica had been constructed by members of Dalbeattie Men's Shed charity and built from the original plans which had been offered from Fiona Sinclair, granddaughter of James Baird Skeoch who died in 1954. As few of these cars were made this is now the only known physical example of the Skeoch cyclecar.

Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, or simply Cedar Fair, was an American company headquartered at its flagship Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. The company was a publicly traded master limited partnership that originally formed in 1983 following Cedar Point's acquisition of Valleyfair, in which the name of both parks were combined to form the name Cedar Fair. By 2006, the company's portfolio had grown to eleven amusement parks, eleven outdoor water parks, and one indoor water park in the US and Canada. The acquisition of Schlitterbahn added two more outdoor water parks in 2019.
Cedar Fair and longtime rival Six Flags merged on July 1, 2024, forming a new company and retaining the Six Flags name. Announced in November 2023 as a merger of equals, former Cedar Fair leadership remained in control of the new company, along with two former Six Flags executives. The company's headquarters will reside in Charlotte, North Carolina, a site once occupied by Paramount Parks before its acquisition by Cedar Fair in 2006, while the company will continue to use its Sandusky office location for financial and administrative operations.
== History ==
Cedar Point Amusement Park began as a bathing beach resort in the 1870s, and its growing popularity as a recreational destination led to the formation of Cedar Point Pleasure Resort Company in 1887. The company was founded with the purpose of expanding the resort commercially. An economic depression in the 1890s threatened the resort's future, however. A newly formed business, Cedar Point Pleasure Resort Company of Indiana led by George Arthur Boeckling, purchased Cedar Point for $256,000 in 1897. It was later reorganized as the G.A. Boeckling Company.
The resort thrived under Boeckling's leadership, which lasted through 1931. G.A. Boeckling Company continued to control operations at the amusement park for much of the 20th century. A proposal in 1974 to build an amusement park in Cambridge Township, Michigan, was contemplated and later abandoned the following year. Then in 1978, Cedar Point acquired Valleyfair amusement park. Parent company Cedar Fair Limited Partnership, commonly known as Cedar Fair, was formed in 1983. Its name was derived from both parks – "Cedar" representing Cedar Point and "Fair" representing Valleyfair. The company went public on April 29, 1987. Under Cedar Fair's leadership, Cedar Point grew to become one of the largest amusement parks in the world, and the company increased its portfolio by acquiring other amusement properties throughout the United States.
=== Dick Kinzel era ===
The first acquisition of the new Cedar Fair company came in 1992 when Cedar Fair bought Dorney Park from Harris Weinstein. Cedar Fair also bought Worlds of Fun from Hunt-Midwest in 1995. One of the biggest acquisitions came in 1997 when Cedar Fair bought Knott's Berry Farm from the Knott family. This marked the first time Cedar Fair operated a year-round amusement park. The acquisition included operations of the Camp Snoopy indoor park at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. In 2005, Cedar Fair withdrew from the lease arrangement leaving Mall of America to manage the park on its own. Mall of America formed a partnership with the Nickelodeon franchise in 2007 and continues to operate under the name Nickelodeon Universe. Several new water park properties named Knott's Soak City opened around the southern California area since the acquisition which included Buena Park in 1999, Chula Vista in 2000 and Palm Springs in 2001. Michigan's Adventure in Muskegon, Michigan was purchased for $27.6 million in 2001.
Cedar Fair opened its first indoor water park in November 2004, Castaway Bay. It was added to the former Radisson Hotel which was then renamed. The indoor waterpark resort is open year-round.
Larger acquisitions followed in 2004 with Six Flags Worlds of Adventure. Cedar Fair purchased the park for $145 million, reverting its name to Geauga Lake, as it was before its Six Flags branding in 2000. Subsequently, Cedar Fair stripped the park of all references to Looney Tunes and DC Comics characters which were licensed properties owned by Six Flags. The zoological and marine life portion of the complex (SeaWorld Ohio), which was annexed to the theme park in 2001, was also shuttered. Six Flags retained ownership of the animals. The amusement park remained in Cedar Fair's portfolio through 2007, and the water park continued to operate as Wildwater Kingdom through 2016.
On May 22, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it had outbid competitors and intended to purchase all five parks in the Paramount Parks chain, including Star Trek: The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton and the management agreement of Bonfante Gardens. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it had completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at US$1.24 billion. Shortly following the transfer of ownership, Cedar Fair began the process of integrating the two companies. With the purchase of the Paramount Parks, Cedar Fair LP announced that it would do business under the name Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Cedar Fair LP remains the legal company name.
The individual parks continued to operate under their Paramount names during the 2006 season, however Cedar Fair began removing the Paramount name and logo from the parks in January 2007. The names of the parks were changed back to their original pre-Paramount names (the Paramount's prefix was removed) with the Cedar Fair corporate logo added. Bonfante Gardens was changed to Gilroy Gardens. Cedar Fair began removing references to Paramount Pictures. Although the acquisition granted Cedar Fair a ten-year licensing deal for Paramount names and icons, such as Star Trek, Cedar Fair opted to terminate the agreement and not pay an annual licensing fee. All references to Paramount/CBS-licensed properties were removed before the beginning of the 2008 season. This deal also included a four-year licensing deal for Nickelodeon names and icons, such as SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats, this agreement was retained until it expired prior to the 2010 season.
In December 2009, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would offer Cedar Fair $11.50 per share, a 28 percent premium over the market price, as part of a takeover plan which would also make Cedar Fair a private company. The deal included a cash payment of $635 million in addition to assuming Cedar Fair's debt of over US$1.7 billion putting the total value of the transaction close to US$2.4 billion. Cedar Fair planned to hold a shareholder meeting on March 16, 2010, to vote on the transaction but postponed the meeting to April 8, 2010, implying that two-thirds of the shareholder vote needed for approval wasn't yet secured. On April 6, 2010, the deal was terminated, and Cedar Fair paid $6.5 million to reimburse Apollo for expenses incurred from the proposed transaction. Cedar Fair also adopted a unitholder rights plan as a preventative measure to help protect unitholders in the event of any future hostile takeover.
On September 16, 2011, JMA Ventures, LLC entered into an agreement to purchase California's Great America from Cedar Fair and take ownership of the Gilroy Gardens management contract. The agreement required approval of Santa Clara's city council which was scheduled to vote on the matter on December 6, 2011. However, JMA canceled its plans to purchase Great America and bowed out of the agreement.

Cedar Fair launched new websites for their parks in 2012 as well as a new marketing campaign, Thrills Connect.
On November 20, 2012, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its Knott's Soak City: San Diego location to SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. About nine months later, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its Knott's Soak City: Palm Springs location to CNL Lifestyle Properties. Cedar Fair's portfolio, according to an SEC report filed in 2013, contained eleven amusement parks, four outdoor water parks, one indoor water park, and five hotels.
On September 5, 2016, Cedar Fair closed Wildwater Kingdom, the last operating part of the former Geauga Lake & Wildwater Kingdom. A portion of the land that once contained both properties has since been redeveloped.
=== Richard Zimmerman era ===
On October 4, 2017, Cedar Fair announced that Ouimet would step down as CEO and be succeeded by COO Richard Zimmerman on January 1, 2018. Ouimet would remain with the company, taking the newly created position of executive chairman of the board of directors.
On March 27, 2019, Cedar Fair announced it was purchasing the land occupied by California's Great America from the City of Santa Clara. The 112 acres beneath the park cost $150 million. Cedar Fair had been previously leasing the land from the County of Santa Clara for 6 to 7 million per year.
In April 2019, Cedar Fair announced a partnership with Feld Entertainment to bring a Monster Jam Thunder Alley Area to select Cedar Fair parks.
On June 13, 2019, it was announced that Cedar Fair had signed a $261 million deal with Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts to buy their Galveston and New Braunfels locations, with the option to buy Schlitterbahn Kansas City for an additional $6 million, and the rights to the Schlitterbahn name.

On December 31, 2021, the contract to manage Gilroy Gardens expired. Both Gilroy Gardens Inc., the nonprofit that owns the park, and Cedar Fair agreed not to renew the contract.
On February 1, 2022, news broke that SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment made an unsolicited all-cash bid to buy Cedar Fair for $3.4 billion. Exactly two weeks later, on February 15, 2022, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment issued a statement that the offer had been rejected.
In June 2022, the company announced that it was selling the land occupied by California's Great America to Prologis, a real estate development company, for $310 million. Cedar Fair signed an 11-year lease from the buyer and intends to close the park at the conclusion of the lease.
On November 2, 2023, Cedar Fair announced plans to merge with Six Flags, forming a new company and retaining the Six Flags name. Described as a "merger of equals", former Cedar Fair management will remain in control of the new company, which will be headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, a site once occupied by Paramount Parks before being acquired by Cedar Fair in 2006. Some financial and administrative operations will continue to reside in Sandusky, Ohio. The combined company was projected to have 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks, and 9 resort properties in its portfolio and would operate under the Six Flags name with plans to use Cedar Fair's stock exchange ticker symbol, FUN. President and CEO of Cedar Fair, Richard Zimmerman, will serve as President and CEO of the new combined company, while Selim Bassoul, President and CEO of Six Flags, would become the executive chairman of the company's board of directors.

== Fast Lane ==
Fast Lane is an expedited queue system in use at parks formerly associated with Cedar Fair. It was first announced for Kings Island on July 18, 2011. The park served as the testing park for the system. For an increased cost, visitors get a wrist band which gives them the ability to wait in a shorter queue for most attractions. Originally, it could only be used from noon to 7:00 PM, but it was soon expanded to be available all day. Fast Lane would be rolled out to all Cedar Fair parks for the 2012 season. There is also Fright Lane, which is Fast Lane for the haunted attractions during the Halloween events. For the 2016 season, Cedar Fair began testing all season Fast Lane at Valleyfair and Dorney Park. By the 2019 season, all parks offered all season Fast Lane.

Ricky Lee Nixon (born 3 April 1963) is a former Australian rules footballer in the VFL/AFL and a former sports agent. At the height of his career, he was one of the most high-profile sports agents in Australia, and a powerful figure in the AFL.
== Football career ==
Recruited from Golden Square in the Bendigo Football League, Nixon played four games for the Carlton Football Club between 1983 and 1985, for one goal, amid limited opportunities (he was an emergency 13 times in their 1982 premiership year). The half-back flanker then moved to St Kilda—where he played 51 games, including one final—and scored 32 goals between 1986 and 1991, but Nixon was never really able to establish himself with the club.  A contractual dispute with the Saints in March 1992 saw him move to the Hawthorn Football Club, where he played eight games, including one final for six goals, before his retirement in 1993.
== Sports agent career ==
Possibly the most high-profile sports agent in Australia, Nixon established his sports management company, Flying Start, in 1994 after eight years of teaching physical education at Carey Grammar. The company grew considerably to become one of the leading sports management companies in Australia.  Nixon was a pioneer of group marketing of prominent athletes in Australia with his Club 10 team of AFL players, which included Gary Ablett Sr., Wayne Carey, Jason Dunstall, Tony Lockett and Garry Lyon. 
He is widely acknowledged as a major leader in the innovative marketing of athletes and has been rated by The Age newspaper as the fourth-most-influential person of the past decade in the AFL. In 2000, Nixon rorted the salary cup to secure his client Wayne Carey an additional $400,000 in salary. According to Nixon, when the AFL complained about this manoeuvre, he simply told them "I run the competition, not you."
Flying Start's players included Matthew Richardson, Ben Cousins, Nick Riewoldt and Tom Hawkins. Nixon started a fitness club at Docklands Stadium, where he also co-owned the Locker Room Bar and Cougars Sports Bar with Michael Gudinski.  He also commentated AFL on radio station Triple M and has been awarded the Australia Day Sports Medal for services to sport by the prime minister.  He has since entered the education business with Flying Start providing online courses, including "How to be a Sports Agent".
In 2008, Nixon began a well-publicised campaign to escalate the Irish experiment and set up a formal system for recruiting promising young Irish Gaelic footballers for AFL teams. The plan was criticised by many Gaelic football officials and players, including Sydney's Tadhg Kennelly. Some consider that the campaign, which included screening camps in Ireland in August 2008, will result in a talent drain from Ireland to Australia, something that Nixon refutes.
=== Controversy and loss of accreditation ===
Nixon was deeply affected by the death of his longtime friend Clinton Grybas in January 2008, and subsequently lapsed into drug and alcohol addiction. In an interview with News.com.au, Nixon stated that "(After Grybas’ death) I started drinking, I had never done drugs in my life. I started doing cocaine, and I got addicted." In 2009, Nixon received a drink driving charge when he left the scene of an accident that he was involved in. 
On 19 February 2011, it was claimed by a number of press agencies that Nixon had an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old girl. The girl had previously been embroiled in a series of controversies involving players from the St Kilda Football Club, including one of Nixon's major clients, Nick Riewoldt. Nixon admitted to visiting the girl at her hotel room on at least three occasions and providing her with alcohol. The girl characterised the relationship as an "affair" and indicated that she was unaware at the time that Nixon was married.
Nixon fled Australia for London following the incident. He described an incident in which he pondered suicide while in England, but was talked out of it by former St. Kilda President Rod Butterss, who encouraged him to return to Australia.
He was given a two-year suspension by the AFL Players' Association Accreditation Board, on 18 March 2011. Following the loss of his accreditation, Nixon entered negotiations to sell his agency, Flying Start. Former Richmond Football Club president Clinton Casey purchased the agency for $900,000.
In July 2012 Nixon was charged with five offences following an alleged assault. In March 2013 Nixon pleaded guilty to charges of assault against his former fiancée and attempting to flee the police. He was sentenced to 200 hours of community service. In May 2013 Nixon was pulled over by police for speaking on his mobile phone while driving; he was found to also be driving while intoxicated and with a suspended licence.
In 2013, Nixon launched a stand-up comedy routine titled "Chicken Train", and announced plans to perform at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.
Nixon has now been accused of kneeing a police officer while in court facing prior assault charges. The incident reportedly occurred at the Melbourne Magistrates court where Nixon was facing charges stemming from an incident in March 2022. In the case, Nixon was accused of unlawful assault and discharging a missile, after Nixon reportedly assaulted a man in Port Melbourne. Nixon's lawyers claimed that the former football agent was acting in self-defence at the time.
== Later career ==
In 2014, Nixon relaunched Flying Start International as a sports agency and consultancy, having retained the rights to the brand. He also stated that he did not intend to regain accreditation. In 2015, Nixon was arrested for allegedly threatening to assault a two-year-old child on Facebook.
In January 2019, Nixon, along with his son's Lewis and Mitchell, started a charity known as Kicking for Cancer. It holds a charity football match every year to raise money to go towards kids with cancer.
In July, he started a new business, Vital Health Checks. The business goes around in ex-Ambulances and gives people health checks on location.

Major General Sir Herbert Ralph Hone   (3 May 1896 – 28 November 1992) was a British Army officer, barrister and colonial administrator.
== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Ralph Hone was born in Hove, Sussex, and was educated at Varndean Grammar School, Brighton. Hone's mother died while he was in his teens; his father, "a man of character", went on to become mayor of Brighton in 1937. His family, the Hones, were distant relations to Nathaniel Hone the Elder of the famous painting, writing, cricket and diplomatic dynasty the Hones. However, Ralph's upbringing was far removed from that of his forebears.
=== World War I ===
In April 1915 Hone passed the British civil service examination. He then joined the Inns of Court Regiment and was commissioned in July 1915 in the London Irish Rifles. He was posted to the 1/18th battalion and was involved in the Battle of Loos in autumn 1915. Hone served in the Notre Dame de Lorette sector and then at Vimy Ridge. During this time Hone was hospitalised with acute trench fever and impetigo. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 April 1917, and to acting captain on 14 January 1918.
On 21 March 1918, the Germans opened their Spring Offensive with 6000 guns. Hone's company halted the German's first infantry assault, capturing 25 German prisoners. Hone was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his actions when the Germans attempted to enfilade the British lines, becoming severely wounded in the process. The full citation for the medal appeared in The London Gazette in September 1918 and reads as follows:
For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when in command of a company. He led his men with skill and courage and drove out a party of the enemy who had penetrated into his trench. Later, he held the right flank of his battalion against a determined bombing attack, when he was severely wounded. By his action and example he undoubtedly saved the situation at a critical moment.
He was repatriated to England, and by the end of the war had been promoted to a captain. The day after the armistice with Germany in November he married Elizabeth Matthews (b. 1894/95), with whom he later had two children, a son and daughter.
In 1920, Hone left the army and joined the colonial service in Uganda. He trained as a barrister and on his first long leave was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1924, during which time he aided in the prosecution of Patrick Mahon, the perpetrator of the Crumbles murders. The next year, he was appointed Zanzibar's registrar to the high court; followed by resident magistrate. His legal career continued with an appointment as crown counsel in Tanganyika, followed by Attorney General of Gibraltar (1933–36). While he was in Gibraltar the Spanish Civil War broke out; domestic duties included acting as chairman of the Gibraltar government slum clearance commission. From Gibraltar he was posted to Uganda from 1937 to 1943, as Attorney General of Uganda.
=== World War II ===
Hone was made commandant of the Uganda Defence Force following the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1941, he was transferred to General Headquarters Middle East, first as legal advisor to advise on law in the conquered Italian territories and later as chief political officer. In March 1943, he was promoted to major-general, "to ease his command over the Brigadiers under him"; he was also appointed Commander of the CBE. 
This was followed by a period in the War Office in London, dealing with the war situation in South-East Asia. While working at South East Asia Command (SEAC) headquarters he got to know Louis Mountbatten, later Earl Mountbatten of Burma. In August 1945, Hone was sent to Malaya, to oversee the handover to civilian rule, and was present at the Japanese surrender at Singapore on 12 September.
=== Post-war career ===
Hone married again in 1945, and had a son by his second wife Sybil. Hone was awarded the Knight Commander of the KBE in 1946. He served as Secretary-General to the Governor-General of Malaya for two years from 1946, followed by Deputy Commissioner-General in south-east Asia from 1948 to 1949, and in 1949 he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of North Borneo. Hone was considered a great success as Governor of North Borneo, encouraging the country's recovery from the ravages of the Japanese occupation and expanding the colony's export trades. He was appointed  in 1951.
=== Later years ===
Hone was head of the legal division of the Commonwealth Relations Office from 1954 to 1961, when he retired from the civil service, and resumed practice at the bar. Given his background in diplomacy and overseas service, he also held many important advisory posts both at home and overseas: his final advisership was to the Bermudan government from July to November 1966.
Hone was Vice President of the Royal Commonwealth Society. He was also an active freemason, a member of the higher degree of freemasonry, the Ancient and Accepted (Scottish) Rite 33º.
Hone was also Bailiff Grand Cross of the Venerable Order of St John. He died on 28 November 1992.
An archive of Hone's papers dating from 1937 to 1972 has been deposited at the Bodleian Library of Commonwealth and African Studies at Rhodes House, part of the University of Oxford. The reference for the records is MSS Brit Emp s 407, MSS Ind Ocn s 271.
In addition, the papers of Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma held at Southampton University Library include correspondence with Hone relating to South East Asia Command 1944–1946. The reference for the records is MB1/C124.
A steam engine was named in his honour, the Hunslet-built 40604T "Sir H. Ralph Hone", which is now displayed in the Sabah Museum, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah.

Edwin Vernon Westfall (born September 19, 1940) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Boston Bruins and New York Islanders from 1961 until 1979.  Notable as a defensive specialist often tasked with defending against the star scorers of opposing teams, Westfall played most of his career as a right wing, although he played stints on defence in his earlier years and at centre in his later years. After his playing career ended, he became a color commentator on Islanders' broadcasts until 1998 when he retired from that position.
== Playing career ==
He played his junior hockey with the Barrie Flyers and Niagara Falls Flyers, and started his professional career with the Kingston Frontenacs. By 1961 he joined the Bruins, although he had stints the next two years with the Frontenacs and the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League (AHL). By 1966, he was firmly ensconced on Boston's checking line.
Westfall won the Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins in 1970 and 1972. He was on the ice on Bobby Orr's famous Stanley Cup-winning goal in 1970 and also scored the second of the three fastest goals in National Hockey League (NHL) history, when the Bruins scored three goals in 20 seconds in a 1971 game with the Vancouver Canucks. During those seasons he made his reputation as a preeminent penalty killer (generally paired with centre Derek Sanderson or winger Don Marcotte), enough so that he was named to play in the NHL All-Star Game in 1971, 1973, 1974 and 1975. Westfall scored 18 shorthanded goals for Boston during the regular season and added six more in Stanley Cup play for the Bruins.  The latter mark--which he shares with Sanderson--is still the club record.
Westfall was chosen by the New York Islanders in the 1972 NHL Expansion Draft. He was subsequently made the first captain of the team, a position he held until the 1976–77 season. Westfall scored the first goal in franchise history in their first game against the Atlanta Flames on October 7, 1972, and was the first player to represent the Islanders in a NHL All-Star Game, in 1973. His best season statistically was in 1974–75, when Westfall led the Islanders to their first playoffs and into the Stanley Cup semifinals, exploding in the playoffs with five goals and 10 assists to cap a 22-goal, 55-point regular season.
He remained an effective scorer through the 1976–77 season, in which he was awarded the Bill Masterton Trophy for perseverance and dedication, after which he relinquished the team captaincy to Clark Gillies. His scoring declined sharply in his final two seasons, during which he spent his time on checking lines and penalty killing.
== Retirement ==
Westfall retired having played 1226 career NHL games, scoring 231 goals and 394 assists for 625 points.
After the end of his playing days, Westfall became the Islanders' color commentator for what was then known as SportsChannel New York. He was often dubbed "18" by his confidant and broadcasting partner Jiggs McDonald because, during his playing career, he wore that number and by his former Islander teammates. Westfall continued in that position until he retired in 1998, and former St. Louis Blues player Joe Micheletti replaced him in the broadcast booth. He made occasional appearances on Islanders' broadcasts for several seasons after that.
Westfall was part of CTV's broadcast team for the 1984 Canada Cup tournament and select NHL on CTV broadcasts. He provided reports and did interviews from the ice level.
On November 19, 2011, Westfall was inducted into the New York Islanders Hall of Fame. The Islanders held "Ed Westfall Night" in his honor. He and his former partner in the booth "Jiggs" McDonald called the second period in the game that night between two of his former teams, the New York Islanders and the Boston Bruins.

George Craig Cruikshank (1881 – October 1951) was the seventh Bishop of Waiapu from 1945 to 1946. He used his second name, Craig, as can be seen in his final, poignant letter to his diocese, in which he closed "To one and all, my wife and I say farewell in grateful remembrance of all you have been to us. Ever your friend, CRAIG WAIAPU," adopting the traditional episcopal form of replacing his family name with that of his diocese.
He was born in 1881 and educated at Keble College, Oxford. He was ordained in 1908 and was a curate at St Hilda's Church, Darlington and then vicar of Whangarei. This was a position he technically held twice, from 1910-1913, and then from 1914-1923, as during the war years he served as a chaplain to the first New Zealand Expeditionary Force. From 1923 to 1932 he was vicar of Remuera. In 1932 he became Dean of Dunedin, a post he held until his ordination to the episcopate.
He was elected Bishop of Waiapu in November 1944 and consecrated and enthroned (in the terminology of the day) in February 1945.
Unfortunately he was affected by ill health, and forced on medical advice to resign only a little over a year after his enthronement. Bishop Cruickshank retired to Russell and was nursed by his wife Kate (née Stephenson) until her sudden death in Whanganui in December 1947. He died on 30 Sep 1951, his funeral service was held at St. Mark's, Remuera, and he is buried in the churchyard of the historic Christ Church Anglican church in Russell.

World Online (WOL) was a European Internet Service Provider (ISP) which came to prominence in the late 1990s dotcom boom.
Founded by Dutch entrepreneur Nina Brink, World Online's name indicated its aspiration to rival the hugely successful American ISP, AOL (America On-Line). The company aimed to provide free internet access across Europe. It launched its full internet service in the Netherlands in 1996, and grew rapidly to have a presence in 15 European countries and South Africa; counting some 1.9 million customers by the year 2000.
Based in Rotterdam, Netherlands, the company’s principal shareholders included the Swiss-based Sandoz Family Foundation, Dutch mobile provider Telfort, Reggeborgh Beheer (an investment company) and Intel.
== IPO ==
WOL's IPO in 2000 proved a disaster and left the reputations of the banks, the Amsterdam stock exchange and the company itself tarnished.
It was set to be officially listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on March 17, 2000. It was underwritten by ABN AMRO and Goldman Sachs, and promoted via a pan-European ad campaign involving hired celebrities like royal Sarah, Duchess of York, actor Christopher Reeve, and rocker Joe Cocker.
The initial price of the stock was set at €43, giving the company a valuation of €12 billion — the largest ever IPO for the Amsterdam exchange, and the largest IPO of any European Internet company. The initial offer on the AEX was 21 times oversubscribed.
However, not everyone was confident the company’s success was secure. World Online’s 1999 revenues totalled a mere €64 million, while net losses reached €91 million. More telling, while WOL was a giant in the Netherlands, it was a minor player in most of its other markets. It was not even among the top five players in the crucial markets of France, Germany, or Italy. Moreover, the €12 billion valuation assessed the company’s 1.9 million subscribers at a high €6,500 each. France-based ISP LibertySurf, which did an IPO the day before WOL's, valued its subscribers at less than €3,000 each.
In pre-launch trading in London's gray market, World Online's shares were going for upwards of €72.  When the AEX opened on Friday, March 17, trading in WOL stock was fast; some 57 million of the 64 million new WOL shares were traded on that first day. Although the price rose briefly to €50, the upsurge was not to last. Trading had to be suspended three times after price falls, and the stock finally ended the day back at €43.
On its second day of trading, WOL tumbled 16% below its listing price. By March 22 the stock was trading at €31. The stock continued to fall over the next days; its value plunging from €12 billion to €5 billion in a week.
The tumbling share price coincided with the disclosure that Nina Brink had sold her stake in the ISP in December, prior to the flotation, for $60 million. A San Francisco-based private equity house, BayStar Capital, purchased her slice of the business at just $6.04 a share.
Dutch investors, including World Online staff who took up loans from the company to buy shares, were outraged. Many claimed that they would never have invested in the company in the first place if they had known Brink had already sold her shares. Though the prospectus noted that Brink had "transferred" her shares, aggrieved shareholders claimed that they were misled because the prospectus should have said she "sold" her shares to Baystar.
It later became known that, fearing a market collapse, the banks had wanted the WOL float to go ahead quickly. The AEX, however, had threatened to stop the initial offering because of Brink's pre-selling of most of her holding. ABN Amro responded by threatening an injunction against the exchange.
The AEX wanted Brink to lock up the shares transferred to Baystar, and $25 million being her participation in Baystar. She agreed to an extra lockup arrangement on shares she still controlled, and this was put in the prospectus. As a result of an apparent deficiency in Dutch law, it was not necessary for Brink's shareholding to be fully disclosed in the prospectus.
The exchange eventually permitted the listing after it was shown that Baystar had not agreed to a lock-up agreement to keep its shares for a time, as is usual in such situations. In fact, Baystar had been an aggressive seller from the first day of trading.
== Post IPO ==
Brink resigned from her job in April under pressure from employees and investors. In May, a class action was brought to a Dutch court alleging that World Online, its bankers, ABN Amro, and Brink broke Dutch securities regulations when the ISP floated on the Amsterdam stock market.
James Kinsella, an American, previously CEO of MSNBC.com, replaced Brink as Chairman of World Online in June. He curtailed marketing and the editorial department, and fired 150 employees at the Rotterdam corporate headquarters. He focussed on becoming a network operator and increasing subscriber numbers by introducing a flat-fee service, but the company was limited in its success of stimulating growth. Kinsella eventually sold World Online to Tiscali, an Italian competitor, in a deal that valued WOL at more than $5 billion.
== Sale to Tiscali ==
On September 7, 2000, World Online and Tiscali, an Italian ISP, announced their intention to combine the two companies to create a pan-European Internet network company. The new company would provide new telco, media and e-commerce services to the largest pan-European customer base.
The combination maintained the Tiscali name and its headquarters in Sardinia, Italy. Renato Soru, the founder of Tiscali, became Executive Chairman with James Kinsella becoming Chief Executive.
Tiscali emerged from the all-share deal with 56.7% of the new company while World Online had 43.3%. The merger created, with over 6 million subscribers, the second-largest ISP in Europe, after Deutsche Telekom's T-Online.
The move gave Tiscali access to the cash raised by World Online at its IPO. The new company was set to have a market capitalisation of about $11.2 billion and be a market leader in Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and the Czech Republic.
In November 2000 the HQ of World Online was raided concerning allegations of insider trading. In February 2001, Kinsella resigned from his position after clashing with Soru. Kinsella went on to become Chairman of Interoute, a large European network operator owned by the Sandoz Family Foundation. Brink is now a Dutch tax exile living in Brasschaat, Belgium. Renato Soru was elected President of the Sardinia Region of Italy in 2004.
== Delisting ==
On 12 January 2001, WOL was deleted from the stock market because Tiscali owned all the stocks.

The Sackwald is a ridge, up to 374 m above sea level (NN) high, in the Lower Saxon Hills in the district of Hildesheim in the North German state of Lower Saxony. It is named after the village of Sack in the borough of Alfeld, the name meaning "Sack Forest".
The Sackwald is part of the geological structure of the Sack Basin or Sackmulde along with the Sieben Berge and the Vorberge.
== Geography ==
The Sackwald lies on the eastern edge of the Leine Uplands in the Lower Saxon Hills. It is located between the town of Alfeld on the River Leine to the northwest and the rather more distant town of Bad Gandersheim to the southeast.
The Sackwald is surrounded by the ridges of the Vorberge to the north, the southeastern foothills of the Hildesheim Forest to the north-northeast, the Sauberge to the northeast, the Harplage to the east-northeast, the Heber to the east, the Helleberg to the south and southwest, the Selter (on the other side of the Leine valley) to the southwest and the Sieben Berge to the northwest.
Topographically it transitions into the last-named ridge seamlessly. Several streams rise within or on the edge of the Sackwald, whose waters eventually empty into the westward-running Leine or the northeast flowing Innerste; the ridge thus lies on the watershed between the two rivers. 
The unpopulated Sackwald is crossed by several forest tracks and hiking trails, which enable the densely forested landscape to be explored. They include the Rennstieg path that runs through the forests and the Hohe Schanze Historic Educational Path (Historische Lehrpfad Hohe Schanze). The ridge may be reached over winding state roads (Landesstraßen) branching off the B 3 and B 64 federal roads, and link, for example, Alfeld, Freden and Lamspringe with one another.
=== Hills ===
Amongst the hills in the Sackwald are the following (heights in metres above sea level (NN)): 
Ahrensberg (374 m) – southwest of Woltershausen and northeast of Everode
Paradiesgarten (336 m) – north of Everode
Teufelskirche (330 m) – north of Everode
Saurenberg (321 m) – north-northwest of Everode
Hohe Schanze (326 m) – east of Winzenburg, site of the ruins of a Frankish mission station
Gehlenberg (ca. 315 m) – west-southwest of Lamspringe
Hainholzberg (ca. 300 m) – southwest of Adenstedt on the boundary with the Vorberge
Kratzberg (ca. 300 m) – north of Alfeld-Hörsum
Menteberg (300 m) – east of Alfeld
Rüstiberg (288 m) – east of Everode
Mullenberg (278 m) – north of Everode
Winzenberg (272 m) – northeast of Winzenburg, site of Winzenburg Castle
Buchenberg (270 m) – north-northwest of Everode
Feldberg (267 m) – west-southwest of Lamspringe
Horstberg (ca. 250 m) – east-southeast of Alfeld-Hörsum
Tiebenberg (ca. 240 m) – north of Winzenburg, site of the Tiebenburg cultural monument
=== Waterbodies ===
Amongst the streams in or on the Sackwald are: 
Gande, rises in the southeastern part of the Sackwald, eastern tributary of the Leine
Leine, passes the Sackwald a few kilometres away to the southwest, southern tributary of the Aller
Riehe, rises in the southeastern part of the Sackwald, southwestern tributary of the Lamme
Winzenburger Bach, rises in the southern part of the Sackwald, eastern tributary of the Leine
=== Villages ===
Amongst the villages on the edge of the Sackwald are: 
Adenstedt in the catchment area of the Riehe, north-northeast of the Sackwald
Alfeld on the Leine, northwest of the Sackwald
Bad Gandersheim on the Gande, a few kilometres southeast of the Sackwald
Everode in the catchment area of the Leine, west of the Sackwald
Freden on the Leine, south-southwest of the Sackwald
Lamspringe on the Lamme, east of the Sackwald
Sack (Alfeld) the village the forest was named after, northwest of the Sackwald
Winzenburg on the Winzenburger Bach, south of the Sackwald
Woltershausen in the catchment area of the Riehe, east of the Sackwald
== Points of interest ==
Apart from the forested landscape itself, the points of interest in the Sackwald include the ruins of a Frankish mission station on the Hohe Schanze, the ruins of Winzenburg Castle on the Winzenberg and the cultural monument of Tiebenburg on the  Tiebenberg. Also worth seeing are the ruins of the Schulenburg Chapel, which stand northeast of Langenholzen and north of Sack (both in the borough of Alfeld) at about 185 metres above sea level on the southwestern edge of the neighbouring Vorberge.

A customer engineer (CE) is a worker  whose primary job scope is to provide a service to customers who have signed a contract with the company. Originally, the term was used by IBM, but now customer engineer is also being used by other companies.
== About ==
Customer engineers are also referred to as customer support engineers or customer service engineers. Most customer engineers provide corporate technical assistance which includes debugging mainframe computers and developing outdated products. Customer engineers need to keep up to date on the latest technical developments in their company's customers. Part of their job description requires servicing special equipment that has broken down or seemingly run its course. Many of the engineers are asked to repair specific equipment and others focus on just helping clients. The role of customer engineer has spread to other companies in different industries such as technology, aviation, and telecommunications. Customer engineers are in charge of repairing large-scale networking problems.
== IBM customer engineer (IBM CE) ==
Originally simply engineer, those who specialized in servicing IBM equipment in use by its customers were designated customer engineers by Tom Watson circa 1942. 
Based on the requirements, an IBM CE could be a Field CE and service many customers around a defined territory, e.g.: Kuala Lumpur, or they could be based at the place of business of a particularly large customer and service only that one customer e.g.: Tenaga Nasional.
== NCR customer engineer (NCR CE) ==
The title of CE or customer engineer is used by National Cash Register (NCR) to designate specially trained personnel who are charged with the installation, maintenance and repair of equipment and systems according to contracts with end users. They can be charged with service of either point of sales (POS) systems or with ATM machines.

The Hansens renamed it the Jamestown Sun, and Byron served as publisher. In 1988, Byron's son Gordon (who had taken over as publisher) sold the paper to the American Publishing Company (later Hollinger International); they sold it in 2000 to the current owner, Forum Communications.  The paper moved from evening publication to a morning edition in 1992.

The Galil Jewish–Arab School is a primary school in Israel. Founded in 1998, it is the first Israeli school to have a dedicated joint Jewish–Arab social structure. The school is located in Eshbal, a kibbutz in the Misgav region of the Galilee near the Arab-majority city of Sakhnin in the Northern District.
== History ==
The Galil Jewish–Arab School was established in 1998 by Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish–Arab Education in Israel, an Israeli network for socially-integrated bilingual schools. In 2007, the school had a student body of 200 Jewish and Arab students (Jews, Muslims and Christians) in grades 1 through 6. The school's students live in Sakhnin, Sha’ab, and communities of the Misgav Regional Council, whose populations have expressed support for bilingual and multicultural education.
== Educational model ==
In line with the multiculturalist objectives of Hand in Hand, the Galil Jewish–Arab School maintains an equal number of Arab and Jewish students; each class has two teachers, one Arab and one Jewish, the school has two co-principals, also split between Arab and Jewish.
Hand in Hand's approach to bilingual education aims to create equality, understanding, and coexistence between the Arab and Jewish populations of Israel, who often live segregated from one another due to the historical effects of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Classes at Hand in Hand schools are co-taught by an Arab and Jewish teacher, and consequently integrate student learning in both Arabic and Hebrew. Teachers do not actively translate, providing a strong incentive for students to attain fluency in their non-native language.

Metabolic myopathies are myopathies that result from defects in biochemical metabolism that primarily affect muscle. They are generally genetic defects (inborn errors of metabolism) that interfere with the ability to create energy, causing a low ATP reservoir within the muscle cell.
== Types ==
Metabolic myopathies are generally caused by an inherited genetic mutation, an inborn error of metabolism. (In livestock, an acquired environmental GSD is caused by intoxication with the alkaloid castanospermine.) Metabolic myopathies cause the underproduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within the muscle cell.
The genetic mutation typically has an autosomal recessive hereditary pattern making it fairly rare to inherit, and even more rarely it can be caused by a random de novo genetic mutation, or autosomal dominant, X-linked, or mitochondrial. Metabolic myopathies are categorized by the metabolic pathway to which the deficient enzyme or transport protein belongs. The main categories of metabolic myopathies are listed below:
Muscle glycogen storage diseases (Muscle GSDs) and other inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism that affect muscle—defect in sugar (carbohydrate) metabolism. The deficiency occurs in the cytosol of the muscle cell.
Fatty acid metabolism disorder (fatty acid oxidation disorder, FAOD)—defect in fat (lipid) metabolism, anywhere along the pathway, starting from entering the muscle cell and ending at converting fatty acids into acetyl-CoA within the mitochondrion. The deficiency occurs in the cell membrane, cytosol, mitochondrial membrane, or within the mitochondrion of the muscle cell.
Nucleotide metabolism disorder—defect in purine nucleotide cycle enzyme (such as AMP deaminase deficiency). Purine nucleotide metabolism is a part of protein catabolism, and the purine nucleotide cycle occurs within the cytosol of the muscle cell.
Mitochondrial myopathy—defect in mitochondrial enzymes or transport proteins for oxidative phosphorylation (including citric acid cycle and electron transport chain), excluding those for fatty acid oxidation. Occurs in the mitochondrial membrane or within the mitochondrion of the muscle cell.
== Symptoms and signs ==
In the event more ATP is needed from the affected pathway, the lack of it becomes an issue and symptoms develop. People with a metabolic myopathy often experience symptoms such as:
Exercise intolerance,
Abnormal muscle fatigue (premature fatigue and/or inability to get into second wind), muscle pain (myalgia), cramping or muscle stiffness during and/or after exercise,
Shortness of breath (dyspnea), or rapid breathing (tachypnea), or heavy breathing (hyperpnea), or both (exercise hyperventilation)
Inappropriate rapid heart rate in response to exercise (tachycardia),
Exaggerated cardiorespiratory (breath and heart rate combined) response to exercise (dyspnea/tachypnea/hyperpnea and tachycardia),
Exercise-induced myogenic hyperuricemia (exercise-induced accelerated breakdown of purine nucleotides in muscle via adenylate kinase reaction and purine nucleotide cycle), 
Transient muscle contracture or pseudomyotonia (like a really bad cramp that can last for hours, which is myogenic and EMG silent),
May have progressive muscle weakness, 
May have a pseudoathletic appearance (hypertrophy or pseudohypertrophy) especially of the calves,
Reddish-brown urine (myoglobinuria) and considerable breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis).
The degree of symptoms varies greatly from person to person and is dependent on the severity of enzymatic or transport protein defect. In extreme cases it can lead to rhabdomyolysis. The symptoms experienced also depend on which metabolic pathway is impaired, as different metabolic pathways produce ATP at different time periods during activity and rest, as well as the type of activity (anaerobic or aerobic) and its intensity (level of ATP consumption). 
A majority of patients with metabolic myopathies have dynamic rather than static findings, typically experiencing exercise intolerance, muscle pain, and cramps with exercise rather than fixed muscle weakness. However, a minority of metabolic myopathies have fixed muscular weakness rather than exercise intolerance, imitating an inflammatory myopathy or limb girdle muscular dystrophy. It is uncommon that both static and dynamic signs predominate.
== Mechanism ==
At the cellular level, metabolic myopathies lack some kind of enzyme or transport protein that prevents the chemical reactions necessary to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often referred to as the "molecular unit of currency" of intracellular energy transfer. The lack of ATP prevents the muscle cells from being able to function properly. Some people with a metabolic myopathy never develop symptoms due to the body's ability to produce enough ATP through alternative pathways (e.g. the majority of those with AMP-deaminase deficiency are asymptomatic).
H2O + ATP → H+ + ADP + Pi + energy → muscle contraction
ATP is needed for muscle contraction by two processes:
Firstly, ATP is needed for transport proteins to actively transport calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of the muscle cell between muscle contractions. Afterwards, when a nerve signal is received, calcium channels in the SR open briefly and calcium rushes into the cytosol by selective diffusion (which does not use ATP) in what is called a "calcium spark." The diffusion of calcium ions into the cytosol causes the myosin strands of the myofibril to become exposed, and the myosin strands pull the actin microfilaments together. The muscle begins to contract.
Secondly, ATP is needed to allow the myosin to release and pull again, so that the muscle can contract further in what is known as the sliding filament model.
ATP is consumed at a high rate by contracting muscles. The need for ATP in muscle cells is illustrated by the phenomenon of Rigor mortis, which is the muscle rigidity that occurs in dead bodies for a short time after death. In these muscles, all the ATP has been used up and in the absence of further ATP being generated, the calcium transport proteins stop pumping calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the calcium ions gradually leak out. This causes the myosin proteins to grab the actin and pull once, but without further supply of ATP, cannot release and pull again. The muscles therefore remain rigid in the position at death until the binding of myosin to actin begins to break down and they become loose again.
== Diagnosis ==
The symptoms of a metabolic myopathy can be easily confused with the symptoms of another disease. As genetic sequencing research progresses, a non-invasive neuromuscular panel DNA test can help make a diagnosis. Whole genome sequencing is required in more complex cases. If the DNA test is inconclusive (negative or VUS), then a muscle biopsy is necessary for an accurate diagnosis. In mitochondrial myopathies involving a single mtDNA deletion, DNA would have to be tested from affected muscle tissue rather than saliva or blood as unaffected tissues would show normal or near normal levels of mtDNA.
A blood test for creatine kinase (CK) can be done under normal circumstances to test for signs of tissue breakdown, or with an added cardio portion that can indicate if muscle breakdown is occurring. In metabolic myopathies, baseline CK is either normal or elevated. An electromyography (EMG) test is sometimes taken in order to rule out other disorders if the cause of fatigue is unknown. In metabolic myopathies, the EMG is either normal or myopathic, but spontaneous activity is usually absent.
An exercise stress test can be used to determine an inappropriate rapid heart rate (sinus tachycardia) response to exercise, which is seen in GSD-V, other glycogenoses, and mitochondrial myopathies. A 12 Minutes Walk Test (12MWT) can also be used to determine "second wind" which is also seen in McArdle disease (GSD-V) and phosphoglucomutase deficiency (PGM1-CDG/CDG1T/GSD-XIV).
A cardiopulmonary exercise test can measure both heart rate and breathing, to evaluate the oxygen cost (∆V'O2/∆Work-Rate) during incremental exercise. In both glycogenoses and mitochondrial myopathies, patients displayed an increased oxygen cost during exercise compared to control subjects; and therefore, can perform less work for a given V̇O2 consumption during submaximal daily life exercises.
In fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAOD), while at rest, some exhibit cardiac arrhythmia (commonly various forms of tachycardia, but more rarely, conduction disorders or acute bradycardia); while others have a normal heart rhythm.
Some GSDs and a mitochondrial myopathy are known to have a pseudoathletic appearance. McArdle disease (GSD-V) and late-onset Pompe disease (GSD-II) are known to have hypertrophy, particularly of the calf muscles. Cori/Forbes disease (GSD-III) is known to have hypertrophy of the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, quadriceps, and thigh muscles. Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, type 1H (which as of 2017 was excluded from LGMD for showing signs on muscle biopsy as being a mitochondrial myopathy, but not yet assigned new nomenclature) is also known to have hypertrophy of the calf muscles. Hereditary myopathy with lactic acidosis (HML), another mitochondrial myopathy, also has hypertrophy of the calf muscles in some.
Blood test may show a disturbance in pH, with lactic acidosis (low pH) in mitochondrial myopathies either at rest or exercise-induced. Glycogen storage diseases may show transient exercise-induced alkalosis (high pH), hyperammonemia, and myogenic hyperuricemia. During a non-ischemic forearm exercise test, in GSDs the plasma lactate typically fails to rise (and may fall below resting levels); except for a few GSDs such as phosphoglucomutase deficiency (GSD-XIV), deficiency of functioning myophosphorylase-a (autosomal dominant PYGM), phosphorylase-b kinase deficiency (GSD-IXd), and Pompe disease (GSD-II) where lactate production is normal. In myoadenylate deaminase deficiency (AMPD1 deficiency), there is no rise in ammonia. Some fatty acid oxidation disorders show lactic acidosis, hypoketotic hypoglycaemia and hyperammonemia, while others are asymptomatic.
Differentiating between different types of metabolic myopathies can be difficult due to the similar symptoms of each type such as myoglobinuria and exercise intolerance. It has to be determined whether the patient has fixed (static) or exercise-induced (dynamic) manifestations; and if exercise-related, what kind of exercise, before extensive exercise-related lab testing is done to determine the underlying cause.
Adequate knowledge is required of the body's bioenergetic systems, including:
which circumstances constitute anaerobic exercise (blood flow restricted by contracted muscles, insufficient oxygen and blood borne fuels, particularly isometric exercise, as well as sudden increased intensity) versus aerobic exercise (blood flow unrestricted);
anaerobic metabolism (phosphagen system and anaerobic glycolysis — ATP produced without oxygen, regardless of adequate blood flow or not, quickly produces ATP which is useful in high-intensity activity and the beginning of any activity) versus aerobic metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation — ATP produced with oxygen, adequate blood flow required, slow to produce ATP but produces for longer and high yield);
the different sources of ATP (phosphagen system, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism [including ketosis], protein metabolism [including the purine nucleotide cycle], oxidative phosphorylation);
how long does each source take to start producing ATP;
how long does each source continue to produce ATP;
how long does each source take to replenish;
how much ATP can each source generate;
and which fuel source is primarily used given the intensity of the activity.
For example, leisurely-paced walking and fast-paced walking on level ground (no incline) are both aerobic, but fast-paced walking relies on more muscle glycogen because of the higher intensity (which would cause exercise intolerance symptoms in those with muscle glycogenoses that hadn't yet achieved "second wind").
When walking at a leisurely pace on level ground (no incline), but there is loose gravel or sand, long grass, snow, mud, or walking into a headwind, that added resistance (requiring more effort) makes the activity more reliant on muscle glycogen also. These and other surfaces, such as ice, can make you tense your muscles (which is anearobic requiring muscle glycogen) as you protect yourself from slipping or falling.
Those with muscle glycogenoses can maintain a healthy life of exercise by learning activity adaptations, utilizing the bioenergetic systems that are available to them. Depending on the type of activity and whether they are in second wind, they slow their pace or rest briefly when need be, to make sure not to empty their "ATP reservoir."
== Treatment ==
Metabolic myopathies have varying levels of symptoms, being most severe when developed during infancy. Those who do not develop a form of a metabolic myopathy until they are in their young adult or adult life tend to have more treatable symptoms that can be helped with a change in diet and exercise. It might be more accurate to say that metabolic myopathies described as adult-onset, it isn't necessarily that they didn't develop in infancy (they are inborn—from birth—errors of metabolism) but that they didn't display severe enough symptoms to warrant the attention of medical professionals until their adult years (severe symptoms such as rhabdomyolysis, fixed muscle weakness due to years of repetitive injury, or the de-conditioning of muscles from a more sedentary adult lifestyle which exacerbated symptoms).
Due to the rare nature of these diseases, it is very common to be misdiagnosed, even misdiagnosed multiple times. Once a correct diagnosis has been made, in adult years, looking back symptoms were present since childhood, but either brushed-off as growing pains, laziness, or told that they just needed to exercise more. It is especially difficult to get a diagnosis when symptoms are dynamic (exercise-induced), such as in muscle glycogenoses. Sitting in a doctor's office (at rest) or doing movements that only last a few seconds (within the time limit of the phosphagen system) the patient wouldn't display any noticeable abnormalities (such as muscle fatigue, cramping, or breathlessness).
A brief or only mildly elevated heart rate (heart rate taken while sitting down after recently walking across the room or getting up on the examination table) might be assumed to be due to anxiety or illness rather than exercise-induced inappropriate rapid heart rate due to an ATP shortage in the muscle cells. In the absence of severe symptoms (such as hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, acute compartment syndrome or renal failure), it is understandable that a disease would not be noticed by medical professionals for years, when at rest the patient appears completely normal.
Depending on what enzyme is affected, a high-protein or low-fat diet may be recommended along with mild exercise. It is important for people with metabolic myopathies to consult with their doctors for a treatment plan in order to prevent acute muscle breakdowns while exercising that lead to the release of muscle proteins into the bloodstream that can cause kidney damage.
A ketogenic diet has a remarkable effect on CNS-symptoms in PDH-deficiency and has also been tried in complex I deficiency. A ketogenic diet has demonstrated beneficial for McArdle disease (GSD-V) as ketones readily convert to acetyl CoA for oxidative phosphorylation, whereas free fatty acids take a few minutes to convert into acetyl CoA. As of 2022, another study on a ketogenic diet and McArdle disease (GSD-V) is underway.
For McArdle disease (GSD-V), regular aerobic exercise utilizing "second wind" to enable the muscles to become aerobically conditioned, as well as anaerobic exercise that follows the activity adaptations so as not to cause muscle injury, helps to improve exercise intolerance symptoms and maintain overall health. Studies have shown that regular low-moderate aerobic exercise increases peak power output, increases peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), lowers heart rate, and lowers serum CK in individuals with McArdle disease.
Regardless of whether the patient experiences symptoms of muscle pain, muscle fatigue, or cramping, the phenomenon of second wind having been achieved is demonstrable by the sign of an increased heart rate dropping while maintaining the same speed on the treadmill. Inactive patients experienced second wind, demonstrated through relief of typical symptoms and the sign of an increased heart rate dropping, while performing low-moderate aerobic exercise (walking or brisk walking). Conversely, patients that were regularly active did not experience the typical symptoms during low-moderate aerobic exercise (walking or brisk walking), but still demonstrated second wind by the sign of an increased heart rate dropping. For the regularly active patients, it took more strenuous exercise (very brisk walking/jogging or bicycling) for them to experience both the typical symptoms and relief thereof, along with the sign of an increased heart rate dropping, demonstrating second wind.
== Society and culture ==
The American TV show, Diagnosis, in episode 1 Detective Work, an athletic 23-year-old nursing student, Angel Parker, experiences episodes of extreme muscle fatigue, pain and cramping after prolonged exercise, sometimes followed by dark urine (myoglobinuria) and elevated CK (rhabdomyolysis). These episodes can leave her immobile for hours. She had experienced muscle pains since childhood, passed-off as "growing pains." Her first hospitalization was at age 14, for intolerable leg pain that woke her in the middle of the night, sobbing uncontrollably from the intense pain. After multiple hospitalizations for myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis, many misdiagnoses, and many different doctors and tests that were unable to give an explanation for her symptoms, through the assistance of the show genetic sequencing confirmed that she had CPT-II deficiency (a fatty-acid metabolism disorder).
In 2010, Walk over Wales (WoW), the first walking course for those with muscle glycogen storage disease occurred to teach participants activity adaptations, swap notes, and raise public awareness. Led by Andrew Wakelin, participants came from around the world, including Stacey Reason, Dan Chambers, Andy Williams, Charlton Thear and Dr. Ros Quinlivan. From Great Orme to Cardiff Bay, in 32 days they walked 210 miles (338 km) and ascended approximately 35,000 feet (10,700 metres) through Snowdonia National Park, the Cambrian Mountains, and Brecon Beacons National Park. There have been many walking courses over the years since, growing in participation at international locations.
Mattie J.T. Stepanek (1990-2004), an American poet and peace activist, died aged 13 from dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy, an inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and impairs heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, and digestion. Predeceased by his older siblings, he was survived by his mother (then aged 44), who was diagnosed in 1992 with a late-onset form of the same disease.
Charles Darwin (1809-1882), an English naturalist and biologist, suffered from a chronic illness that has been speculated to have been MELAS syndrome (a mitochondrial myopathy).

Chaetocorophium is a monotypic genus of amphipods in the family Corophiidae, containing only the species Chaetocorophium lucasi. Chaetocorophium is very closely related to Paracorophium, and some researchers propose synonymising the two genera.
C. lucasi is endemic to New Zealand, where it is found only in a few sites in the North Island (Lake Rotorua, Lake Waikare, Lake Rotoiti, at Whakatāne, Raglan, Waitara, and Whanganui) and in lakes and intertidal mudflats across South Island. It is epigean, and was listed as "Sparse" in the 2002 New Zealand Threat Classification System list for freshwater invertebrates.

The 1914 Arizona Wildcats football team was an American football team that represented the University of Arizona as an independent during the 1914 college football season. In their first season under head coach Pop McKale, the team compiled a 4–1 record, shut out four of six opponents, and outscored all opponents by a total of 85 to 20. The team captain was Turner Church Smith.
Following a game against Occidental College in Los Angeles, a story in the Los Angeles Times noted: "The Arizona men showed the fight of wild cats . . ."  In response to the Timesstory, the Arizona student body adopted the "Wildcats" as the team's nickname.
The season included the resumption of the Arizona–Arizona State football rivalry after a hiatus of 12 years.  The Wildcats won the game by a score of 34 to 0.

Acanthoma fissuratum, also known as granuloma fissuratum is a cutaneous condition characterized by local thickening of the skin in response to pressure caused by an eyeglass frame.: 777  Acanthoma fissuratum is a hard, folded, flesh-colored lesion or plaque with a central groove. It affects the ear and is common in people wearing poorly fitting spectacle frames. It can also affect other locations like the penis, outer auditory canal, and posterior forchette of the vulva.
== Signs and symptoms ==
In its classic form, it manifests as a single, hard, folded coin-shaped lesion, flesh-colored papule, nodule, or plaque that has a central groove that splits it in half (a look similar to a coffee bean). The retroauricular sulcus, superior auricular sulcus, and the lateral portion of the nose bridge at the inner canthus are common sites for acanthoma fissuratum affecting the ear when it occurs in people wearing poorly fitting spectacle frames. Nonetheless, there have also been reports of involvement at other locations, including the penis, outer auditory canal, and posterior forchette of the vulva.
== Causes ==
The lesions develop as a result of various factors, including improperly fitting eyeglass frames, the weight of the spectacles, concurrent skin diseases, and deformities in the anatomy.
== Diagnosis ==
Acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and varied parakeratosis are seen in the histopathology. The longitudinal groove, which is matched by central attenuation in the epidermis, may be filled with keratinous debris or inflammatory cells. Variable perivascular nonspecific chronic inflammatory infiltration is seen in the dermis.
== Treatment ==
The mainstay of treatment for acanthoma fissuratum consists of removing the persistently irritating stimuli, which typically causes the lesion to reverse. In severe situations, further techniques like electrosurgery, intralesional corticosteroids, and surgical excision may be employed.

The double-lined fusilier (Pterocaesio digramma), also known as the double stripe fusilier or blacktipped fusilier, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a fusilier belonging to the family Caesionidae. It is widespread around reefs in the Indo-West Pacific region.
== Taxonomy ==
The double-lined fusilier was first formally described as Caesio digramma in 1865 by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker with the type locality given as Ambon Island in Indonesia. In his 1987 review of the Caesionidae, Kent E. Carpenter placed this species within the subgenus Pisinnicaesio. The specific name digramma means 'two lined', a reference to the two yellow stripes on each side of the body, one on its back and one on its flanks.
== Description ==
The double-lined fusilier has a fusiform and elongated body which is moderately laterally compressed. There are small conical teeth in the jaws and on the vomer and palatines. The dorsal fin contains 10 spines and 14–16 soft rays while the anal fin has three spines and 11–12 soft rays. There are scales on both the dorsal and anal fins. There are 20–22 rays in the pectoral fins. This species attains a maximum total length of 30 cm (12 in). The overall colour is bluish-green lightening towards the lower body. There are a pair of slender yellow stripes along the back and middle of the flank. The caudal fin lobes have dark tips. The more ventral yellow stripe is mainly underneath the lateral line,  apart from the portion on the caudal peduncle.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The double-lined fusilier is found in the Western Pacific Ocean where it occurs from Indonesia, Western Australia and New Caledonia to southern Japan. It has also been recorded off Norfolk Island and in Tonga. The record from Réunion is probably a mis-identified Pterocaesio marri. It occurs in coastal waters at depths down to 50 m (160 ft), mainly around coral reefs.
== Biology ==
Double-lined fusiliers feed on zooplankton in midwater where they gather in large schools. They are oviparous, laying many small pelagic eggs. Spawning takes place close to sunset when the spawning fish break away from the school, usually followed by "sneaker" males. A male selects a female and starts to push at and nip at her belly before pushing her and then the pair start to swim in half circles around each other. This is when up to 15 sneaker males join in as it is now that the initial pair release eggs and sperm while belly-to-belly at the surface. The sneakers closest to the pair also release their sperm at this point; the pair and the sneakers then return to the school.
== Fisheries ==
The double-lined fusilier is subjected to heavy fishing pressure in many parts of its range. They are caught using drive-in nets, gill nets and fish traps, as well as by illegal blast fishing.

Martin Anthony Maggio (October 29, 1949 – April 25, 2011) was an American musician best known for his legendary Saxophone playing.   His playing was compared to that of the late Boots Randolph yet some people say his version of  “Yackety Sax” was even better than Boots.
== Biography ==
Maggio was born in Houston, Texas and raised there as well attending high school at Jeff Davis High School.
When Marty was just a child his mother Ann Maggio would trade her spaghetti to Marty's music teacher Michael Spompanato for clarinet lessons.  Soon after Marty turned his attention to the Saxophone and that was it. At age 16 Marty joined his first band called the PerryMates, headed by Clarence Perry.  While with the PerryMates Marty and the band hooked up with Roy Orbison and they even auditioned at Orbison's house.  He hired them and they toured with him for some time.
After Marty finally parted with PerryMates and Roy Orbison he ended up recording some tracks with the Nashville Horns and Elvis Presley.  Marty's main work with Elvis was playing backup on his I washed my Hands in Muddy Water track.
Marty's next big run in was when he realized a friend of his by the name of Richard Kemp knew Boots Randolph well.  Richard hooked up Marty and Boots and it was magic.  When Boots heard how good Marty's version of  “Yackety Sax” was he then invited Marty up on stage to play with him.  Together they did a double sax version of the song and this was said to be the first time Boots ever invited another sax player to play with him.
Next Marty hooked up with another Nashville musician by the name of Jim Vest, leader of the Nashville Cats. Marty started with the Cats in 1972 and was involved in more recording sessions.  In 1976 Marty decided to return to Houston and get back into circulation in his hometown. Marty cut about half a dozen cd's such as Sax Tradition, Simple things, Jump Jives and Wail and his newest release “YES” Country which was released just months before his death.  Marty was also said to be in negotiations to play Sax on American Idol performer John Wayne Shultz album,
On April 25, 2011, at 61 years of age Marty unexpectedly died of a possible heart attack.

TÜSİAD, the Turkish Industry and Business Association (Turkish: Türk Sanayicileri ve İş İnsanları Derneği), is Turkey's top business organization.
Founded in 1971, TÜSİAD is a voluntary, independent, non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting public welfare through private enterprise. TÜSİAD promotes principles of participatory democracy, a competitive market economy, environmental sustainability, and universal freedoms and human rights. The Association supports independent research and policy discussions on important social and economic issues in Turkey and abroad. TÜSİAD is composed of CEOs and executives from major industrial and service companies in Turkey, including Fortune 500 companies. The current Chairman is Simone Kaslowski, and the Secretary-General (CEO) is Bahadir Kaleagasi.
== About ==
TÜSİAD represents more than 4,000 member companies, which represent half of Turkey's value-added, 80% of Turkey’s total foreign trade volume, more than 50% of private sector employment, and 80% of corporate tax revenue.
== Structure ==
TÜSİAD headquarters are in Istanbul, and there are seven representative offices: Ankara, Brussels, Washington, D.C., Paris, Berlin, Beijing, and London.
TÜSİAD's activities are structured around round tables led by members of the board of directors and 36 working groups.
TÜSİAD partners with the Brookings Institution, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, and the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF).
TÜSİAD is a member of the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC), Global Business Coalition, and BusinessEurope.
== Political Context ==
TÜSİAD is considered Turkey's secular, pro-Westernization business organization (For its pious Muslim counterpart, see MÜSİAD). In the early 2000s, TÜSIAD coordinated heavily with the newly elected AKP majority, with the shared aim of joining the European Union. TÜSIAD is also credited with laying the groundwork for Turkish support for the Annan Plan on Cyprus. However, as the EU accession process began to deteriorate in 2006, then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's administration reversed course away from the EU, driving a wedge between the two. Since then, TÜSİAD has embarked on a project of public diplomacy, opening representative offices in European capitals and Washington, D.C. to engage and collaborate with relevant actors in the private sector and the general public.
In June 2016, TÜSİAD released a statement criticizing a proposed law which would enhance the government’s authority to appoint boards of trustees for companies. The controversial article was later removed from the law.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has criticized TÜSİAD on multiple occasions. In April 2015, Erdoğan was critical of comments made about the Turkish economy. In December 2014, Erdoğan criticized the organization for apparently sidestepping his office after then TÜSİAD President Haluk Dinçer explained the organization works with the prime minister and ministers whose business is related to the organization’s efforts, not the president.
Though occasionally at odds politically with the ruling AKP, they are a united front on economic matters; immediately following the July 15th 2016 coup attempt, TÜSIAD took out ads in major world newspapers and held high-level meetings with American and European think tanks, NGOs, and government officials in tandem with Turkish government officials in order to brandish Turkey's image abroad and reassure investors of Turkey's economic and political health.
